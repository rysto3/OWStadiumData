More attack speed or dmg. I personally will go for the eye of the spider as i should already have enough attack speed. If not booster jets is a great option as now u should be having  95% attack speed with kitsune up and suzu on you. Crazy i know. \n\nUnless you have been hard farming, u should not have enough for eye of the spider and booster jets at the same time so Aftermarket Pin is a good supplement till u do. \n\nBe sure to have some sort of attack speed or dmg if you choose either eye of the spider or booster jets as putting all ur eggs into one basket will not benefit you too well ( especially if you have too much attack speed and no weapon dmg, trust me you do nothing )",
