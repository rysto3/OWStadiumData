Take this power if you have characters that dive consistently or if you find your team is getting burst. It gives you and your other support a second to breathe and heal up because cause of the massive overhealth it gives. Take this if you have a tank main duo or Genji ^_^ Also not bad with Soldier ult as you can speed him",
