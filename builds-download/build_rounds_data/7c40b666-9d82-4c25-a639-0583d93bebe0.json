I like to spend this round all ability power focused, dashes do more, iaido does more (I think), and it combos pretty well together. Half of the goal here is to make them think you're going all in on ability power so they plan around it next round. The other half is to fund next round. Losing the first two rounds is not only fine but also common, once the build is online you should see results. Also if they have a troubling beam swap either with  [Anti-Beam Coating](item_1ab73e1c-aaa1-4026-89cd-68404db7fd93) but be careful since the animation of swinging the blade leaves you vulnerable.",

Deflect is pure defense?  [Spirit of Sojiro](item_273ac0b7-f669-4641-bd77-2826aadd3218) lets you dash faster after all the damage you didn't take resets your dash. If another power is speaking to you follow your heart.\nSame idea with items. Focus on maintaining 30 attack speed and as much weapon power as you can fit. Or slip some ability power in there if you're making your dashes more lethal. \nThis is not a build intended for seven rounds. If you get here the game is already closer than it should be. You peak early here and try to close it out by round six at the latest. The good news is the game plan doesn't change that much so you already know what to do. Slash n dash to punching distance and start wailing on em. \nAlso dragon blade is another part of genji I haven't mentioned once. It doesn't change much from normal genji blades. Well, 30 attack speed and decent weapon power lets you take down even the tankiest horses if you want.",
