The high AP buff will help us charge our low-cost ults even faster, and the overhealth plus the base Fortify overhealth plus the bonus [Ride with Me](item_40de0b02-ce4b-4a66-8d1c-a129af10caec) overhealth allows you to be pretty greedy with your HP and save yourself with ult. If they run through all that overhealth fast, you can trigger the slam to reset your cooldowns and use them to get out safely.\n\nYou may wish to choose a different purple item to solve/enhance a different gameplay aspect. Against Zarya, [Hollagram Helmet](item_0919f17b-1024-455f-8aa5-df24daa8a126) allows you to free your whole team from grav with Fortify, forcing her to bait out _both_ of your cooldowns in order to safely ult. And even if she does, you can use your own ult to trigger the effect. If your timing is good enough, you can also nullify Earthshatter or Junker Queen's Bow Down ult knockdown, but I personally struggle to time it right even when I know it's coming.\n\nIf you're able to safely javelin spin through enemies (i.e. the enemy tank isn't just going to destroy you if you try to trade with them), [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) can help your team secure kills. If the enemy have several slower ranged heroes (e.g. Ashe, Ana) or tank with limited/no damage-blocking (e.g. Junker Queen),  [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b)'s modest WP buff can combo nicely with [Enhanced Target Sensors](item_d2e9e06c-5315-4ddb-b86a-d0397bd4dbbd) to get kills from range and stack up more AP from your weapon hits. [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) can enhance the lethality of your ults, especially if the enemy is lacking in cleanses. The 25 health buffs from the latter two options are probably not going to help much though.\n\nI've included [Electro Lights](item_d4ac5963-81ea-41b8-bc26-71905fadf860) here because rising enemy HP levels will raise the risk of overheating. You should be able to cover the overheat recovery pretty well with abilities, but it's nice to get it done faster. The attack speed is also very helpful for finishing squishies before they get away.\n\nTake any other blue or green AP buffs you can afford to fill out slots.",

        "notes": "With [Efi\u2019s Theorem](item_609c4cb6-a232-4e08-a11f-5252d40382be), the cooldown reduction during Fortify from [Factory Reset](item_d98df807-9dd6-4553-96bb-a1b49a0fe169) lasts for 6s, which is long enough to get Javelin Spin back again if it was used right before Fortify, and the javelin throw is reduced to 4.5s, all without considering other cooldown reductions. This is why taking a zillion self-heal survival items is a poor build strategy. By instead building to enhance our abilities, we still get oodles of personal survivability, while also greatly increasing our lethality and CC/disruption output, and supporting teammate survivability and aggression. By this point in an Orisa mirror match, the enemy Orisa will usually have 200-300 HP more than I do, and she may even be annoyingly difficult to kill even after her whole team is dead. But her whole team _will_ die while mine lives, unless we do something stupid or they massively out-ult us.\n\nAnyway, I like [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) here, but [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b) and  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) are good cheaper alteratives. If you want to replace the movement speed buff from [Frenzy Amplifier](item_d4b0cfcb-14e9-4472-a688-680120217250), you can take  [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) or  [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054). Fill slots with whatever other blue or green AP upgrades you can afford.\n\nIf you had [Elite Rotator Cuff](item_dfba3349-64b8-4386-8eaf-15bcd1ca6b37) to enhance [Refraction Tiles](item_16e4b34e-d8dd-4cbd-85dc-ff6370cca092) into Zarya, and you have the cash to get another purple upgrade instead, I recommend replacing it. The cooldown reduction in Fortify plus [Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e) gives you plenty of spin uptime already.",

(See note in the Powers section for more details on that.) In combination with [Centripetal Charge](item_4c59fa91-c687-4c6d-810d-ddb79288315a) and  [Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e), you do have the option to treat your ult as a Supercharger + overhealth + ability reset and actually prioritize bongo safety over the actual Terra Surge pull and damage with your positioning. With so much damage flying around in round 7, standing still in the middle of the enemy team can be pretty scary, even with the Fortify damage reduction, so it could be worthwhile trade.\n\nThere's also a good argument for  [Restortify](item_e5073fbb-8287-4d11-934a-1fc1c57a308b), which also benefits from  [Efi\u2019s Theorem](item_609c4cb6-a232-4e08-a11f-5252d40382be). I don't love it because it offers nothing offensive, but it may be worthwhile into beams, or if the enemy team has just been trying really hard to kill you. The healing benefit is less for us than for the HP-stacking Orisas though, since it is percentage-based.\n\n[Advanced Throwbotics](item_20ae3070-5e6b-4352-b024-95b426055ee0) could be good too, if having even more stun/knockback seems useful. Our cooldowns should be quite short at this point, and the enemy team might have enough damage that trying to actually damage them with Javelin Spin might be too dangerous much of the time. If you use Javelin Spin primarily for the bonus Energy Javelin, you can cancel the spin early to start the cooldown sooner and get even more bonus stuns.\n\nFinal items are by preference.",
