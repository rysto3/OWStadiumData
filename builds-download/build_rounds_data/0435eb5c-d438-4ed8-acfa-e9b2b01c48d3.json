Also, apologies for this one being long-winded but I do hope you'll appreciate the explanation.\n\nAlright, so I know this build is called \"Sniper Rein\" and I've mentioned sniping with Fire Strikes. But y'know how Widowmaker still has her SMG for when people try to dive her?\n\nWell Rein still has a big hammer. And I'm sure you've been putting it to used because if you're playing Rein, that's what he does best. But now, we're cranking it up.\n\nSell whatever you have to but make sure you have Rocket Strike, Chimera's Maw, and now Dampener Grip. Why Dampener Grip? Because it makes it so hitting enemies with your hammer reduces the cooldown of Fire Strike (and Charge, but we care more about Fire Strike) by 1 second *per enemy hit*. \n\nNow, take a look at Feeling The Burn. That burn it applies isn't gonna do much damage since we're not stacking any Weapon Power. But we don't care about that. What we *DO* care about is the small fact that the burn effect counts as dealing damage to an enemy with Rocket Hammer for the purpose of Dampener Grips cooldown reduction on our abilities. And that burn ticks (I believe) every half second per target. It will literally refresh *both* charges of Fire Strike over its 2 second duration. And that's after using both charges and your first weapon swing afterwards applying the burn.\n\nYou now get to burn both charges of Fire Strike while going into the enemy, get your swings in, and have both Fire Strikes back up stupidly quick.\n\nIf you still have extra Stadium Cash, go for extra AP like always.",

You could take Nano Cola over Catalytic Crystal to get 5% more AP, but you'd be giving up the extra Ult Charge from AP Damage and I think getting Earthshatters up a bit faster is worth it..\n\nAs usual, we're prioritizing Ability Power for this build as much as possible.",
