This is the case for Juno as we take  [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212) .\n\nWhy not take [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90) first round?\nBecause it's only good when paired with  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb), and you'd only be able to buy it at round 2 at the earliest. You need to get good cash flow on these 2 first rounds first and the power that gives you the most cash is  [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212). It increases your damage AND healing output. No matter what you shoot, it will give you money you'll well spend on the later rounds.\n\nItems:\n\nThe most influential items on 1st round for low HP characters are Survival, though, not using 100% of our cash isnt beneficial so we'll only take 1. [ [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) being our best option for its passive.\n\nThen, to increase our Torpedo damage we buy [ [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) and since we are spamming left click to heal our allies, we'll take  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) in an attempt to squeeze in a bit more healing numbers to earn more cash.",

        "notes": "Round 2, on even numbered rounds we will be maximizing our stats with very cost-effective items such as  [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) which gives us 20% WP for only 4k (its the best ratio you can find for WP, at 200$ per every 1% WP).\n\nThen we'll take a key item to the build:  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) . This item will be your best and only defensive item from Round 3 onwards.\nA tip: right-clicks from now on give you 75 Overhealth as long as you are aiming your torpedos. Once you shoot, the Overhealth dissapears, so if you are trying to escape, hold the torpedos!\n\nNotice how we didnt go full AP with  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) ? That's because our budget is 11.5k and we want to keep our  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) . The extra 25 shields means 12.5 more Overhealth on  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) , and its passive is still really good in this stage of the game.\nGoing for 20% AP isnt very reliable yet since our only AP procc are our torpedos, so to deal more consistent damage, which means more cash for next round, we'll buy  [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) first on this Round 2.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, before the nerfs we used to rush  [Pulsar Destroyers](item_707ad8c7-a153-4140-b4bc-1f23f7d7a648) with a  [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) , but now with the reduced 15% AP on Pulstar Destroyers that only nets us 115.5 damage on our torpedos against just building 20% AP that'll net us 102 damage. For a 13.5 damage difference on a cooldown ability, its much preferable to get the 20% consistent damage from  [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) while keeping our  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) and our [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf). We are not gonna buy [Pulsar Destroyers](item_707ad8c7-a153-4140-b4bc-1f23f7d7a648). Remember, your objective is to get money! You are not looking to win the round, neither to win the teamfights, you just want to stay alive at all times and deal consistent damage and healing, the longer you can deal damage and heal allies the more cash you'll get! Bonus points if you get some kills in the process! But DONT DIE!",

But thanks to our powers we have 6 ability casts on short cooldowns that we can use to abuse  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) .\n\nEvery time you use an ability, the next time you hit an enemy with your primary fire it will deal (25*1.3) 32.5 extra damage!\nAnd since it doesnt expire you can stack one charge of Kitsune while out of combat! You will be able to do: Shoot  Torpedo  Shoot  Glide Boost  Shoot and actually kill people with just 1 torpedo and some left clicks! Its really good especially since at this point in the game people arent building survival items yet (except for tanks of course) and it also heals your allies with an AP ratio so we can focus on AP instead of Weapon Power for our torpedos to deal even MORE damage!\n\nAlso, since we have so many ability casts,  [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) becomes BROKEN on Juno! You literally become [TITLE CARD].\n\nIf you have extra money, buy 25 shields and then 25 armor.\n\nLast thing, [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) is no longer needed as our healing and damage will be based off of AP ratios. So instead we'll take 50 hp which will make an insane difference and 10% Ability Lifesteal. The longer you stay alive, the more you can do, and maximizing our Item slots gives us the best value.",

        "notes": "Again, usually we'd want to take rare items to maximize how much stats we get for our money. In this round our budget is 29.500$ on an average performance, which means we could either get 20% more AP with  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) and 25 armor + 25 hp, OR buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429).\n\n50 HP is no laugh matter, but we already have  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) carrying our survivability.\nAnd while 20% AP means 5 more damage on every  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) procc and 17 more damage on our torpedos,  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) still gives us more damage.\nHere's the math: People by Round 4 have an average of ~280 HP, your primary fire is a burst of many little instances of weapon damage so on a single left-click you should be able to procc  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) its 3 times for 9% of the target's HP as damage. If we shoot your average enemy of 280 max hp, we are dealing 25.2 extra damage after every ability. So instead of dealing extra 5 damage like with building 20% AP, we'll be dealing extra 25. This, on pair with  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) means you are dealing 60.2 extra damage after every Glide Boost, after every Torpedo, after every Hyper Ring. Its just SO much better than going for a full AP torpedo only build, or  [Stinger](item_e9d0d530-d620-4e74-a34d-38cdebfeb9a4) on Round 3 as the previous version of the build was doing.\n\nFun fact! If you shoot a tank like reinhardt with around 700 HP, you will be dealing extra 98 damage on your left-clicks after every ability! So just farm damage shooting tanks now if you want!\n\nAlso, there's an argument for Cybervenom here at Round 4. If you analyze that your biggest obstacle to win the round is an insane ammount of heals comming from the enemy team, aka when you are against two main healers such as Mercy+Moira for example, then this isnt such a bad idea to take now. This doesnt mean every time they run 2 main healers you go Cybervenom, its just an option you have that you'll do maybe 10~15% of the time.",

        "notes": "And finally, if you havent wont by this point, its cause you lack survivability, so we'll take  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) and  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) . Hyper Ring now gives you and your team 100 Overhealth, and every time you use an ability you will start regenerating shields.\n\nIf you have a competent team, you can take  [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) which will make more impact than  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) could in that last round.\n\nHope the build helped! Its been a ton of fun to grind her on Stadium! ~u~ peace! 3",
