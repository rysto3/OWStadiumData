It's super fun to play with, synergizes well with powers we'll pick later on, *and* it's very strong on its own. So long as you're juggling your beam effectively, its basically a +50% increase to your healing & DMG boost output. It's also great for grabbing extra assists, which makes it very good for farming currency!\n\n### ITEMS\n\n [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0)  +  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)  gives you a little extra healing, &  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6)  makes you a little tankier. \n\n [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da)  can be an alternative to  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) , but I prefer  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) because of its straightforward DMG Mitigation. The armor basically gives you at least +7 extra effective HP.",

It turns one of the worst ults in the game into one of the best, has great synergy with many of Mercy's other powers, *and* it's great for farming currency.  I think it's important to build on either round 1 or 2, so we're picking it up here.\n\nTogether with  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb), you build your ult faster, and your ult is much stronger. I consider these two powers irreplaceable for this build.\n\n### ITEMS\n\nFor items, the example is a budget round 3 build that prioritizes HPS.  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124)  gives a substantial increase to your HPS, and its +25 HP makes it an efficient choice for replacing one of your survival items. If you can afford it, I recommend replacing your greens with any of the blue optional items.\n\n#### **Alternatively**, another build to consider when you have more money (25,750+ Currency):  [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca)  |  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a)   |  [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) |  [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054)  |  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0)  |  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) \n\nThis build gives similar HPS (~94 HPS), alongside higher damage boost, faster ult charge, & more armor. I usually prefer this build unless I am in a situation where I need to prioritize healing (ex., with a low-healing cosupport, or team just taking a ton of damage).",

I.e., taking 1 damage gets rid of all of it. Until this is fixed, I would not recommend this power against beam characters like Zarya or Moira, who can instantly deplete the Overhealth from just 1 tick of their weapons.)\n\n [Glass Extra Full](item_659ff350-8602-42cd-b5f9-f4da7e5e912b)  is basically a free Epic Survival Item for all your teammates. It synergizes well with [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) because both your beams can generate Overhealth, making it extra efficient. And with  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb), Valk now gives your teammates +50 HP for its duration. I think this power is best for helping squishy teammates stay alive against burst damage characters like Cassidy & torpedo spam Juno. After playing with it so often, my team feels so fragile when I don't pick it. You do have to yellowbeam more with this power, but its fine. More healing = faster ult = more DMG boost. \n\n**Alternative** Power choices here can be [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591), [Distortion](item_5557e2f2-02df-4eac-8128-0c23b71183b1), or [Battle Medic](item_ccd0edff-4d57-4ac2-83a7-bab6ff0ffb2f). All synergize well with Crep. [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) can also be situationally good if you need help staying alive.\n\n### ITEMS\n\nThe example is another budget build that prioritizes HPS. [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) is the best lower-cost choice for prioritizing healing at this point, but there are other items I prefer in different circumstances.

Just another power that helps keep your team alive.\n\nAlternative Power choices here can be [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591),  [Protective Beam](item_3f1ef995-8ecc-45fb-8b57-26fdccc21feb), or [Battle Medic](item_ccd0edff-4d57-4ac2-83a7-bab6ff0ffb2f). [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) can also be situationally good if you need help staying alive.\n\n### ITEMS\n\nAt this point, [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) is the only item you can take to get more HPS when replacing your blues. [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e)  actually gives you a miniscule amnt of extra HPS compared to other 15% threshold items, but it's fine to replace with other items.\n\nCheck optional item notes for alternative item choices. I recommend *always* keeping [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124), [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b), and [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48), everything else is expendable. This amount of healing is pretty overkill, to be honest, so I do recommend considering the other items.",
