        "notes": "[Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) works just like an Ana Nade. It also synergizes well with the first power,  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9). Usually, in 3rd round, most hitscans focus on WP and deal a lot of damage, which means more healing needed from you, right? With this power in the 3rd round, you WILL get those heals. You can keep alive your DPS, your tank and help your other support with the heals as well.\n\nThis is usually the round where you will focus on your mobility. You will have to fly around a lot and you will fly FAST. We will focus on cooldown reduction if enough money, by buying   [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f) . To be honest, having that perk is a nice addition, because I have almost no cooldown while flying, but not fully necessary yet. Without it, you will have around 1.something seconds cooldown for your GA, which is more than okay.\n\nFlying around this fast and this much will make you very hard to be shot at. However, be careful if there's a Soldier with the  [Super Visor](item_b3db0ab0-26b4-4d99-893d-175f6726c9e9) power or a good hitscan, especially if pocketed. Always be aware of your surroundings and be ready to fly back to safety or around natural covers.",

Keep in mind, the more you fly around to teammates, the more you heal. Attack Power is also nice, because you can heal faster. \n\nI'll be honest, usually my team wins by this point. You have enough Weapon Power to heal everyone, sustain tanks, and ampify the Damage Boost so your DPS does A LOT of damage. Even if this build revolves around healing, don't forget about Damage boosting. Even in stadium, unless the tank needs my help with the healing or the team takes a LOT of damage, I try to keep my Dmg boost percentage above 65% at least.

        "notes": "If you find that teammates need even more healing or maybe you need to pocket your tank more, because your other support can't handle healing your tank for various reasons (the tank is getting focused a lot, takes a LOT of damage, etc), I usually swap  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) with  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b). More WP = more healing. \n\nKeep in mind this also helps with your literal weapon power, the Caduceus Blaster. If you see your teammate is alone and an enemy is next to him, shooting, in some scenarios it doesn't hurt to pull out the Blaster and help your teammate with some extra damage dealt to the enemy. Sometimes, hitting some of those projectile shots helps more than you could think.",
