If you take a lot of risks to get solo kills without having extra hp and die, you will not only spend more time running from the respawn to the action (and therefore earn less), you will also give money to your opponents.\n\nThe exception would be if you have a pocket Mercy. Not some random guy on your team, but a person who will definitely boost your damage. The bonus from Mercy is multiplicative, and together with 10% AP you will deal up to 165.9 damage from a rocket explosion versus 150.8 without an AP item. Without Mercy, who buffs your bullets, not only 15 damage, but even 30 damage is not worth neglecting survival, but with a constant damage boost, it becomes the difference between \"target is killed\" and \"target goes around the corner and they get healed.\"\n\nIf you want to understand exactly how the Helix Rockets work, and how Powers works with them, then read my post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kj4yp9/soldier_76s_rockets_in_stadium_what_you_need_to/",

This bonus will not expire over time if you do not shoot anyone and it scales with ability power. \n\nSo with the first 2-3 bullets you can deal damage like with 5-6. Right after the first shots you fire Helix, and the bonus from Mark of the Kitsune activates again for the next hit if you need to finish off a target. That's why you don't need weapon damage or attack speed, just ability power.\n\nThis item create a turning point: now your build is online and you don't need survival or weapon damage because you will kill others with ability damage faster than they will kill you. You should only look for an opportunity for an off-angle and combo, and run to safety immediately after you finish it. Repeat every 6 seconds. \n\nTherefore, [Track and Field](item_b3750fe4-e416-42b6-ad9e-fe92c7dcffc5) is taken as a second power: so that you can have a Biotic Field every 6 seconds to start a new cycle, and also to compensate for the drop in survivability.\n\nAnd this also means that it's time for you to learn how to do the 3+H+3 combo.\n\nWhat am I talking about? You'll find out from the description for the next round and the notes on the items.\n\nNow you can confidently play as a flanker, or you can spam combos on the main while behind the tank: it all depends on how comfortable you are finding your opportunities and what map it is.",

        "notes": "### Because of the way items work in this build, Soldier has a combo that is meant to optimize your Time To Kill, as well as a benchmark for measuring your burst damage.\n\n**Combo: 3 bullets - Helix - 3 bullets**\n\nThe main reason for the combo is to use the bonus damage from MotK twice: before Helix and after. The second reason is to optimize the time to kill. The third reason is that after buying [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b) , you get 4 stacks of bonus AP for 3 shots, because the damage from MotK is counted as a separate bullet. Also, since MotK is triggered after the first bullet, it will have +5% AP due to SF. And after Helix, your next shot, the fourth of six, will give you a 5th stack and MotK will deal damage with a +25% bonus.\n\nThe last reason for the combo is that if the opponents don't buy survival items and don't increase their HP or armor, then this combo should be enough for you to kill most non-tanks in any round, because your damage will grow faster than the enemy's HP.\n\nHere's another important thing to understand about combos and any other calculations, like \"5 bullets and Helix = X damage\". These are all ideal cases, benchmarks for your build. In a real game, everything depends on your aim and a little bit on luck. The real TTK will be higher than the theoretical minimum.\n\nYou can read more about all this in this post of mine: (in progress)\n\nFurther, I will use the notations 3+H+3 for combos and 5+H for the benchmark with five bullets and rockets under your feet. Why five bullets? Because it takes 0.55 seconds to do that, and after you launch Helix, you can't start shooting for another 0.5 seconds. So 5+H represents your realistic burst damage potential, because it's unreasonable to expect you to hit more than 5 bullets in a row and then launch a good Helix in any situation. Especially since your opponents will start reacting to your actions.\n\n\n#### **Round 4 is extremely important for this build because you can get a serious power spike, while many other builds will only get it on the next round.**\nIn this round, everything depends on how much money you were able to farm, so those who were patient in the first two rounds will get the reward.\n\nNote that I sold  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) and replaced it with  [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2)\nThis is simply an optimization of cost and TTK relative to what your opponents are likely to have. The Nano Cola will give your combo about 10 more damage.\n\n#### Situational option:\n**27750**\nBuy these instead of SF:  [Battery Pack](item_5ff8a68c-8f07-4531-9050-5cc5d9128b77) , [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) and  [Biolight Overflow](item_1220eaec-f913-4de2-816c-0dc070b285d0). You will have good unconditional damage with rockets and from  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) at 65% AP, and your ult will give you and your teammates in a radius of 25 meters 50 overhealth for 3s when activated.  Additional info in the note to Biolight below.\n\n#### When you're short on money:\n**22500**\nBuy [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) and [Shady Spectacles](item_ef9bb72f-a56c-4fb6-a552-5abce0b943d7)\nThe idea is that +5% WP from Custom Stock won't change anything, but an additional 20% lifesteal from Helix's high damage can save your life. 5+H = 306. 3+H+3 = 363",

Usually, you just want to get the most ability power for your money, but sometimes it makes sense to think about survival.

You can assume that your maximum HP will not just be +25%, but +35% or even more if someone is chasing you.\n\nAs for the choice of the third Power, everything is obvious: to increase the damage from rockets even more, take  [Cratered](item_5bb876bf-52b5-496c-a9ea-b68e72ed3be1)",

        "notes": "Maximizing AP is a priority, because killing with rockets is much more reliable than finishing off targets with rifle shots. This may require you to close the distance to less than 10 meters to better hit with rockets and have a chance at direct hits, so it's worth thinking about survival as well.\n\nThat's why, if you have some extra money after buying all the main items, you can sacrifice a small amount of AP to buy either  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) or  [Iron Lung](item_22867dc9-50a1-4523-a77a-2fd67b487b51) \nBut only if your targets don't have a lot of HP! Both items affect your survivability differently and reduce downtime after taking damage, and both items will be in the final version of the build.\n\nAnd vice versa, if your opponents have a lot of HP, increase your AP to 70 and then the combo will deal 470 damage.\n\nDon't forget about  [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0)  this budget option will allow you to get maximum AP for your money without sacrificing survivability.\n\n### What you shouldn't buy:\n[Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505)\nonly 2s of debuff after damage from Rockets is not enough, and if the target gets a lot of healing, it won't help you anyway. It's better to deal more damage at once by increasing AP.\n[Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98)\nyou are not a support, and your rockets are needed to guarantee kills, not to put debuffs on tanks\n[Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4)\nyour ult is pretty weak, especially in the late game\n[Vanadium Injection](item_57953fbc-11ff-4e92-9928-fc59b7be668f)\nthis item will not work for half of the round, and even when it does, only AP and HP are important to you. In addition, even if your ult is weak, it makes sense to use it at the right moment or against Mercy, Juno or Lucio, because they are the hardest for you to kill.\n[Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b)\nyour targets have less than 30% HP only after the rockets explode, and therefore increasing the damage from your shots will not change much. This item is simply not worth the money in this build.\n[Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) \nIn theory, this item seems good, but if you try to actually calculate how much damage it will give you with 300-400 HP targets, you will see that it gives two to three times less than MotK even when the target has no armor. The additional damage does not add to the bullet's damage, but is applied separately and is separately reduced by armor, so with armor the item stops working at all against targets with HP less than 500.",

        "notes": "#### This is your final form!\nFor the fourth Power, you have a choice: either  [On Me!](item_cd2a0247-bc79-4f0b-b9ee-d985e3f9a9a7) to increase survivability by raising max HP and getting a good heal per second, or  [Frontliners](item_20863047-0978-4bcd-b75f-499fac432ff0) for situations when you need a big burst of healing and so that you can save not only yourself, but also your teammates.\n\nBy default, I took [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) \n\nBut since the fourth Power greatly boosts survivability, you can take something else instead:\n\n[El-sa'ka Supressor](item_b4298dd9-9b93-461f-a2e0-843402667100)\nWith 30 rounds in the magazine, it is not difficult for the Soldier to occasionally hit the tank in the head and help the team with a debuff if at this time he cannot find a target for himself. And if you have excellent aim, then this will also help in duels, especially against Moira, Cassidy and Reaper.\n\n[Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) \nIn theory, can help pop Zarya's bubbles faster and finish her off with direct rockets; not sure, needs more testing\n\n[Endgame Equalizer](item_a2143111-8fa0-4e3b-bbcf-12ed54587234)\n**Experimental option!** \nThe idea is this: immediately after using Helix, you press the ult and after 1.2 seconds you have Helix again. In this case, it makes sense to take either  [Biolight Overflow](item_1220eaec-f913-4de2-816c-0dc070b285d0) or  [Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e) along with this item. But keep in mind that this is an all-in option that should allow you to quickly kill 2-3 enemy heroes once per round. Very rarely will overtimes drag out the game so much that you can use two visors.\n\nSo the last thing I want to advise is not to forget about the situational item  [Bomb Diffusal Boots](item_c555901e-1b69-4040-8420-ee81cbaf6d90) during the game. The item can be useful at any stage of the game, depending on the map or the composition of the enemy team. Plus, you'll stop dying from your own rockets exploding, isn't that a wonderful item?\n\nGood luck in your games, because you will definitely need luck to get more direct hits with your rockets!",
