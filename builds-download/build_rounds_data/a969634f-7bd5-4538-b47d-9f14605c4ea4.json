This is an alternative to the tank/rez/valkyrie build, because I don\u2019t believe all that extra protection is necessary. If you feel the same, I hope this build serves you well. \n\nI could not have made some of these discoveries without the lovely Mercy community on Reddit. Big shout-out to all of you who messaged me and helped me fine-tune the build over the last couple days. \n\nTry it out and see what works best for you, this is my go-to as it works best for me, but that does not mean it will immediately make you a better player. Practice, personalize, and give it your best shot. I hope to see you all in the stadium.\"",
