        "notes": "Round 1\n\nI start with Threads of Fate, as that's the fastest way to build money while supporting the team. \n\nI grab First Aid Kit as Mercy has pretty decent movement to escape, and it kicks the support auto heal passive in faster. This is super important in the first round as it allows you to stay alive longer during team fights. If you think that you can outsurvive the damage without the extra health, you can also look at grabbing the Field Rations ability to help you stall on points instead. \n\nThen I grab Compensator and Weapon Grease, as that increases Mercy's healing output and speed. \n\nYour goal this round is to get at least 10k in cash, with the hope being you get 12-14k. (This is also the goal with each round as you progress!!!)",

This allows you to get Caduceus Ex and extend your beam range, along with a base 10 weapon power increase, which boosts your heals. \n\nFrom here there are a couple routes you can take. If you earned 11/12k that round and you've sold the green items then you have another 4kish to spend. \n\nOption 1: Mid-Air Mobilizer\nThis works great if you're using GA often. Adding in weapon power and attack speed both increases your heals and allows you to swap quickly to the blaster for some cheeky damage.\n\nOption 2: Advanced Nanobiotics\nThis adds in weapon power, and then after you heal, it adds on attack speed. You'll be healing often in team fights, so this works great at adding in that little oomph needed to keep a tank up or an ulting Genji. \n\nOption 3: Multi-Tool\nThis adds a cooldown reduction for GA, which will be useful against dive enemies. You'll also have rez up a little sooner, which can also turn a fight!\n\nLeftover cash should be put into repurchasing that Compensator or Weapon Grease that you sold to ensure you could afford your Caduceus Ex and one of the blue abilities.",

        "notes": "Round 3\n\nI have two routes that I go with in Round 3, and it will depend on how much damage my team is taking/how much healing they need. If the other support and I are pouring our all into keeping the team up and they're still falling out, then it's time for the Whambulance. If they're doing just fine surviving and there's no issue, then I tend to grab Crepuscular Circle. I'll have the items I grab listed under each one!\n\nWhambulance Build:\nI find myself building this more than my other build. This build is based on Ability Power to assist with the heals, so you're going to want to sell anything that isn't the Caduceus Ex. From there, you should be able to afford 2-3 blue items and 1-2 green items. The important thing with this build is going to be you surviving to keep the team up. If you didn't earn a lot of money that round, then you can sell Caduceus Ex and focus on building AP and your survivability. \n\nLong Distance Wings - Important for you to have escape/save a teammate that's just a bit out of your normal range. \nNano Cola - That 20% AP comes in handy if you can afford the 6k cost! If not, then this is optional. \nMulti-Tool - If you don't get Nano Cola, then this works fine as well! You get AP and ability cooldown.\nVital-E-Tee - If you find that you're struggling with dive's then you'll want to get this and then Nano Cola instead of the others. \nPower Playbook - This adds on AP\nFirst Aid Kit - Adds shields to the armour as well, so that healing kicks in sooner. \n\nCrepuscular Circle Build:\nThis build is going to be based around you building your ult as fast as possible! You'll want to focus on getting items that will help you get your ult the quickest. \n\nChain Evoker - This will add ult charge from damage boost! Even while giving out heals, you'll want to toss in a tap of DB to be most effective in helping the teammate taking damage win the fight. \nLong Distance Wings - Again, this just works great as an escape and helping a teammate who's out of normal range. \nIcy Coolant - This gives ability cooldown and weapon power. \nTalon Modification Module - This boosts your healing output so you build ult faster\nAftermarket Firing Pin - You'll have increased healing speed to also build ult faster.",

If you are dying often, then your team is not going to do well, so you need to focus on building a tankier/health-based build. You can take out Chain Evoker and replace it with Blessed Boosters, as that allows you to live more,e and you'll be uncatchable. \n\nIf they need more heals, then you're going to want to look at adding in some Weapon Power/Attack Speed as well in order to increase your healing output on your beam on top of your AP heals. For this I like to grab Hardlight Accelorator as it adds in Weapon Power, Cooldown Reduction and a stackable Weapon Power.",
