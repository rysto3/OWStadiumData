Just repeat this process over and over, and you'll start farming BOB for almost every fight.\n\nDon't worry about trying to spam your abilities on cooldown, if you can reposition to apply this process to their whole team rather than just the one person you can see, you're going to get huge damage and lifesteal to stay alive. \n\nREMINDER: Unlike normal matches with Ashe, don't waste your Coach Gun ability on movement. USE IT ON THE ENEMY. This ability alone will burn them EACH for 160 damage (plus your bonus 20% to burning enemies).

        "notes": "Power: Again, this is a choice not many guides did, or when they do, don't provide enough context for why. [Double Barrelled](item_962b847f-140d-41a4-9bac-ddcdb088951e) is what you should grab next. Too many Ashe players are wasting their coach gun on a small movement ability, when each shot has the potential of almost a thousand damage at this point. \n\nUsing the 1st Coach gun shot to blow up your dynamite, followed up by another 2nd coach gun shot is DEVASTATING to groups of enemies. \n\nItems:\nI've been giving extremely low estimates for how many points you should be farming by this point, but we're taking a larger jump this time.\n\n[Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) is the first item to buy because not only has our burn become very strong, but now it's going to slow the healing as well. This will be extremely strong if you're having trouble against someone like Junker Queen and her brawling survivability.\n\nNow if you can afford this [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) should be grabbed. Per dollar, it's the biggest boost to ability power you can get.\n\nOptional Items: \nThe Ashe Burn build is one of the current best point farming Damage Role builds in Stadium. It's not that hard to actually have 4 Purple items by now, so if you can grab [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4), you'll see a HUGE boost to how fast you can farm your Ultimate.",

Now the enemy team doesn't need to just worry about stopping your burn for the damage alone, but rather because they'll be trying to fight with a disadvantage the entire round.\n\n[Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) - Already mentioned this last round, but this item will help you farm BOB very fast. If you want to keep a different blue item, this can just be used as a expensive upgrade to [Silver Lighter](item_858f4336-77ae-4a2d-b26d-cce6e939c54e) \n\nOptional Items:\n\n[Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) Although this one is very expensive, it allows you to replace [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) and still increase your ability power.\n\n[Firestarter](item_8b678022-0eeb-4535-8413-8ad1dbda82d3) - Is a good replacement for [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) if you're still being pressured by Genji/Reaper/etc and don't want to give up your solo survivability.\n\n[B.O.B. Wire Defense](item_aba620e7-f21b-46a7-bc04-809d20201e43) is a good option if you think you're performing really well, but getting no benefit from your BOB.

[My Business, My Rules](item_0dac0a70-77f1-4560-8a4d-16304c022552) should be your default choice here. If you're playing this build correctly, their whole team should be burning the entire round. Shooting them while burning just gives you those abilities right back.\n\nAlternate Choice: If you're still struggling by being targeted by Genji/Reaper/Junker Queen, consider grabbing [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c). With your current Ability Power and Items, two bullets after your coach gun will do a bonus 96 ability damage on top of the normal bullet damage. Why this isn't the first choice, is if you are using coach gun twice in a row, you're missing out on those two bullets.\n\nItems:\n\n[Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) This is my first choice because it will max you out at 100 ability power. HUGE damage boost. Have fun!\n\nAlready mentioned your other options for purples last round, but these are typically my top choices:\n\n[Firestarter](item_8b678022-0eeb-4535-8413-8ad1dbda82d3) - If you're still being pressured by Genji/Reaper/etc and need help staying alive.\n\n[B.O.B. Wire Defense](item_aba620e7-f21b-46a7-bc04-809d20201e43) is a good option if you think you're performing really well, but getting no benefit from your BOB. If they just kill him right away, this will help him stay alive a lot longer.",
