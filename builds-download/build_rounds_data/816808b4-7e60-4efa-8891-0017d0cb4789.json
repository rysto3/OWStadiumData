        "notes": "So, 1st round. Depending on the match you can get a *lot* of cash here. I've gotten up to 21k in the first round. This is due to how broken  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) is. Seriously, this power is insane! It makes mercy a very reliable healer in the first round, being able to heal and damage boost allies with no LOS and Range is something people take for granted. Always pick  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) , trust me.\nAs for the items, I always pick 5% WP and 5% ATK Speed and either  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) or  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) . I tend to lean more into  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) since it gives more survivability (especially against hitscans). You're able to hide and heal up quicker by yourself due to it's effect.",

        "notes": "Here's the thing with this build. Like I said, it makes a lot of cash during an average round. By round 2 you should have enough to buy both  [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) and  [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145) If you don't, don't worry. You can always just buy one and keep focusing on WP and ATK Speed. This is a very strong combo in my opinion, you get 10% WP and 20% ATK Speed, making you end up with 15% WP and 25% ATK Speed, it's a *lot* of healing paired with  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) . I've always tried different things but this pair seems to yield the most results. \n\nNow, this is *my* opinion, but I'm not a big fan of  [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) . Why? Simple, I see it as bait.\nThis build focuses on your own damage and healing which [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) doesn't provide. I'm not saying the item is not good, but I don't think it is as phenomenal as people may think. Yes, 5% DMG boost is a big deal (Bumps it up to 35%) but Stadium is a game mode that doesn't have breakpoints when it comes to DMG. HP bars are *constantly* changing and survival items make those breakpoints disappear. Also, 5% in the early game doesn't make that much of a difference. Feel free to disagree with me, I'm not saying don't buy it, I'm just explaining why I don't like it.",

First of all, you get your ultimate pretty quickly thanks to  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) , Mercy's valk is not the most powerful ultimate in the game, let's be serious. But with  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) it easily becomes the best. DMG Boost *and* healing at the same time!? By the time your first ultimate ends, you can check your stats and you'll see that you have over 2k damage amplified and 4k Valkyrie healing. \nI got so into  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) that I forgot a key detail. If you don't have enough for at least one purple, sell your greens and at least one blue. I heavily recommend  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) as your first purple but  [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) is a great option. If you are selling a blue, prioritize selling  [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145) , there's times you'll be on the ground and this item will do nothing.\nThe best part? Time to pull the glock out! Remember that building WP and ATK Speed also boosts your Blaster's DMG, and by a lot! With a bit of good aim you can start melting everyone who is not a tank.\nDoing damage this way counts towards the cash, so why not? Just do it ;).",

I really like  [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) because it gives you unrivaled self-sustain (even more so when you're ulting with  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) ).\n [First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d) is a good choice if you usually don't get to live after a rez.\n [Battle Medic](item_ccd0edff-4d57-4ac2-83a7-bab6ff0ffb2f) is a fun Power, I won't lie. It works with the build due to the high amounts of WP and ATK Speed we already have, but it's use is ATK Speed *only* for your Blaster, if you want to have fun, go for it! I have done it too, but you will get better results with any other Power.\nBy round 5, a lot of the damage starts to become explosive.  [Protective Beam](item_3f1ef995-8ecc-45fb-8b57-26fdccc21feb) is a really good choice, but it doesn't affect the Mercy, only her allies. That's why I like being selfish going for  [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) .\n\nYou might be thinking. \"What about  [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) ?\" In reality I also don't like this power. You're already getting Valkyrie pretty quickly and if I pick this power early (Round 3) it falls off in the late game. And that last statement also applies to  [Glass Extra Full](item_659ff350-8602-42cd-b5f9-f4da7e5e912b) .",
