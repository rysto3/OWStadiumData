[Boosted Rockets](item_c3e0738f-cce2-431a-ad52-39176df84923) and  [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0).\n\nAll these items together are gonna allow us to have infinite flight, due to the longer glide boost duration and the 5% cooldown reduction, glide boost is gonna have a 100% uptime. \n\n## Extra items ##\n- We are gonna keep  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689)  for survivability.\n\n- What we do with the extra cash is down to your own preference and cash amount.\nYou could either spend it all on AP items, such as  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) +  [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) +  [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) for 50% AP \n\nOR\n\nyou could buy  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) for some extra survivability, and (if have) leftover cash can be spent on 1-2 AP items, for example  [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) +  [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) .\n\nIt all comes down to how well you're doing and if you think the enemy hitscans are good enough to shoot you down. If they have a Soldier76 with the \"aimbot\" power, I would definitely recommend going the safe route and picking survivability over damage this round.\n\n- Lifesteal is good but not a must :)\n- From now on im gonna mark only  [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) in the optionals to show green/blue AP items in general, as to not clutter so much.",

        "notes": "# Powers and items #\n\nPick either [Cosmic Coolant](item_5584169d-94af-4efa-955c-263353a75553) or  [Torpedo Glide](item_b04180a3-c2b2-409c-959e-77e3af6bc7d8).\n\n- [Cosmic Coolant](item_5584169d-94af-4efa-955c-263353a75553) works on reducing the CD even if its not hitting any enemies, so the CD is still being reduced if the torpedoes are mainly aimed at allies to heal. It depends on how hard you're rolling them. Since the default playstyle of this build is to flank and just send nukes on the enemy, the obvious choice would be to pick [Torpedo Glide](item_b04180a3-c2b2-409c-959e-77e3af6bc7d8) cause it doesnt really leave room for you to be with your team healing, but in realty team fights are still gonna happen espacially if your team extends forward cause of the space youre creating. And personally I still like to be behind/above the enemies while they are fighting my allies and just try to aim my torpedoes at literally everyone, that way the CD will be reduced even faster. And in testing, even if your torpedoes does 150 damage per hit, it doesn't reduce the cooldown 3 seconds per enemy hit (the criteria is every 50 dmg you do reduces 1 second but it doesn't follow that rule on torpedoes onehits). So it doesn't really matter how hard your torpedoes hit; one enemy hit only reduces 1 second. Therefore personally id pick  [Cosmic Coolant](item_5584169d-94af-4efa-955c-263353a75553) over  [Torpedo Glide](item_b04180a3-c2b2-409c-959e-77e3af6bc7d8) this round. (We can still get it at round 7).\n\n## Core items ##\nExpecting you were spamming torpedos last round, you should be rich by now. We are going to buy  [Pulsar Destroyers](item_707ad8c7-a153-4140-b4bc-1f23f7d7a648) for big nukes and stack as much AP as possible,  [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) +  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) is what I suggest. \n- But if you're brooke, any item giving 10%+ AP is okay. \n\n## Extra items ##\n[Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) can be sold to make room for more AP. No need for survivability if the enemies are already dead \ud83e\udd23",

Enemy supports should be having alot of healing output by now and we want to counter that with this. If enemies are smart they should be stacking alot of survivability by now aswell so we shouldn't really be able to two-shot people with torpedoes anymore, but having the healing reduction and shooting them a little / team follow up should allow you to kill them quickly anyways. \n\n- If they have enemy hitscans that are REALLY going for you, and you aren't able to escape or get behind walls as fast, you could invest in something from the survival category. I'd suggest  [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) or  [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) or  [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09)",

I rarely pick it but i'll keep it here just in case, as it's not a bad pick still.\n\n## Items ##\nIf you didnt already have  [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) from last round you should be able to afford it now. \n- If you have a Moira or AP Ashe on your team already with this item you don't need to buy it as they are better at applying it than you. Instead i'd suggest you go for a survival item such as  [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643). \n- Or instead or survivability, and you get a bad Juno map that doesn't give you a lot of flight/flank space; letting the enemy team get through chokes and teamfights happen, then you could pick  [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) for more ult charge.\n\n## Notes ##\n\n- If you made it to this round it is either because you did 0-3 and later reverse swept thanks to you bombing from the sky and the enemies not doing anything to counter it, if thats the case then keep playing like you did before. Have fun being a bombardino crocodilo and instantly winning your 4th match in a row. \n\n\n\u2b1c\ufe0f Or you made it here cause something went wrong and you went win after loss. \n- Enemy hitscans immediately shoot you down? \ud83d\udff0 Pick a survivability item, really stick around corners. Don't go flank alone if it has killed you in previous rounds, your nukes have decent range, so it's okay to stay a bit behind your team this round and support team + torpedo everybody. Don't try to overpush this round if you're vulnerable to it, as your death can be the reason you lose the match. \n- Super tanky enemies? \ud83d\udff0  [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505), take an angle, make sure your team is near to follow up and use both torpedo charges with each other as the CD reduction should give you a third charge almost immediately if you hit every enemy. Guaranteed to kill at least one squishy, will make them disoriented as well, and that's why we want our team near so they can take advantage of the enemy being disoriented. \n- Your dpses split off from the team and get picked off early? \ud83d\udff0 Since this Juno build is also meant to have you split off from the team, it's understandable that they die alone since your 2nd support should be staying with the tank. I'd suggest just go with (above) whichever teammate you have that keeps splitting off and feeding. \n- Your tank dies and the push fails? \ud83d\udff0 Check your 2nd supports stats, they should be doing most if not all the healing. If they aren't healing, like if you have a flanky Kiri but shes really bad at it then ask her to... perhaps not.\ud83d\ude1f Having two flank supports should actually be an easy win, as the enemies shouldn't even be able to make it near your tank, except if the flank is done very poorly. If shes the problem then ask her to chill, or you can just switch your playstyle to a more supporty playstyle as Juno is exceptional at multitasking with her torpedoes, being able to heal and do dmg at the same time. Postition yourself behind(above) your team and pick up  [Medicinal Missiles](item_30eeab6c-4a1e-4a16-b9dd-e83d633caa40). \n- Your tank dies and the push fails, but you have a 2nd support who's still doing 8k heals per round? \ud83d\udff0 You either need to distract harder or you need to step back and support your team as well, get  [Medicinal Missiles](item_30eeab6c-4a1e-4a16-b9dd-e83d633caa40).\n- It also depends on which map you get, Illios, Redwood Dam, Collesseo and Nepal (at the choke) are my favorite maps for this build as they have incredible airspace and you can bomb them from miles away, these maps you can play very aggressively on.",
