        "notes": "I would like to preface this by saying that this is kind of an spin-off of my other Mercy build, Damage Boost with a side of Revive. Both builds are good depending on what you're looking for, but this is the version that largely carried me into All Star rank.\n\nI like to start off with  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) first. For the first two rounds, you're mostly going to focus on healing and trying to get damage boost value when you can.\n\nThe most important aspect of attack speed is that it scales multiplicatively with weapon power. With her pistol, it just means more bullets faster. With her staff, it increases the tick rate of the beam. Weapon power and Attack speed are equivalent with beams until you combine them. 20% weapon power or 20% attack speed will net you an extra 12 hps on Mercy's staff for a total of 72. However, if you have both 20% weapon power and attack speed, you actually have 86 hps. If you had 40% weapon power or attack speed, you would only have 84 healing per second. \n\nIt's splitting hairs at first, but as you get to the end of the build, having both does matter.",

This allows Mercy to shoot 9 bullets a second at 30 damage a piece or 270 damage per second with just body shots. Mercy can output 594 damage per second with [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b).\n\nWe talked about the intersection of weapon power and attack speed earlier, but this is where it's more obvious. We have 50% weapon power and 40% attack speed netting us 126 healing per second on our primary beam. If you had 90 weapon power or attack speed, you would only have 114 healing per second, losing out on 12 whole health per second which really can make the difference in breakpoints.\n\nYou're capable of weaving many different playstyles in here at the end. Healing, boosting damage, dealing your own, this makes Mercy extremely flexible and gives you the room to adapt to what the moment needs without being extremely punishing.",
