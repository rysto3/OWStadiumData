If you have *a lot* of cash and brough all the recommended blue items (including the optional ones, excluding Angeliesure Wear) you can get Caduceus EX or Chain Evoker. I find Caduceus EX more useful early on, but you can experiment with your playstyle to see what you like best.",

For powers you once again have options depending on how the rest of your team is doing. At this point I'll generally go for Battle Medic since it stacks with Crepuscular Circle and help with spam, but if you trust your dps (and haven't taken it yet) you could go for Distortion. Or, if your team is still taking too much damage you could go for Triage Unity.",
