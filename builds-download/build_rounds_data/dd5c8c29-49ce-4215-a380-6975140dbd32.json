Hunker Down will give you an extra bio field in the event Rein gets too close, giving you an extra bit of survivability to try and win that fight. \n\nThis round we're also picking up Weapon Jammer, since Rein's often like to stack their attack-speed, this will help slow that hammer down while further increasing your attack speed. Optionally you could consider increasing your ammo reserves further with Commander's Clip - as this will give you a 10% attack speed bonus anyways (although not the reduction on Rein)\n\nYou'll probably have some extra cash here - but that's okay, we've selected the perks we have for a reason - don't get hungup on maxing out purples.",

This perk is effective in many situations, but with Rein's large crit-box, will help extend your bio field as you focus him down. \n\nWe'll finally be dropping shieldbuster and replacing it with Booster Jets. This will give you an increase of 5% attack speed when shooting rein, but also increase your overall attack speed by 20% against any other heroes. Previously shieldbuster was only assisting us when shooting Rein (and any other heroes who happen to have armor or shields). We kept shieldbuster previously simply because Rein is ultimately our main focus, and to put the cash toward other powers. Now that we have the extra cash to spend, we can just get the flat out 20% attack speed increase.\n\nBy this point Rein has likely started flaming his DPS in chat, if he's even still in the lobby.",
