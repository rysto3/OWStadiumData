        "notes": "# Power # \n\ud83e\udea1 **Threads of Fate** - In my opinion, if you don\u2019t start with Threads of Fate, you start off wrong. This power is the best one hands down. You are immediately 50% more effective with both damage boost and healing for the first two rounds and that is more than ANY other power or item can give you.\n\n# Items #\n\ud83d\udd2b **Compensator** - 5% Weapon Power, this is the best 1k item you can get.\n\n\u26fd\ufe0f **Weapon Grease** - 5% Attack Speed, this is the second best 1k item you can get.\n\n\u26d1\ufe0f **First Aid Kit** - 25 Shields + 33% time reduction on your self healing. This is the best survivability tool outside of Blessed Boosters. As Mercy, you are a little gnat constantly flying around and line of sighting everyone so that you don\u2019t die. This gives you an extra 25 regenerating shield and faster recovery for your support passive which Mercy relies greatly on as your second support will usually struggle to heal you.\n\n## I DO NOT Recommend: ##\n\u274c **Running Shoes (1,000)** - This item is useless on spawn as you have GA to assist you, its only use is on respawns and returning you faster to your team. Its only value hinges on you dying. Don\u2019t get it.\n\n\u274c **Winning Attitude (1,000)** - This item\u2019s value hinges on you dying. It\u2019s not worth the ultimate charge.",

It may not be everyone\u2019s favorite, but it\u2019s definitely mine.\n\n\n## Option 2: ##\nIf you were the last person to die in your teamfights, or if you never died at all\u2026 **Congrats!** You probably have pretty good positioning and may not need to rely on Blessed Boosters to keep you alive for one more round. Build as much weapon power/attack speed as you possibly can using the mid-game item list. Try to keep the stats even with each other.\n\n\n## I DO NOT Recommend: ##\n\u274c **Icy Coolant (5,000)** - 10% Weapon Power + 10% CD Reduction (CD Reduction is not the focus on this build and is really only valuable for rez-based builds. There are better things to buy with your cash.)\n\n\u274c **Mid-Air Mobilizer (4,000)** - 5% Weapon Power + 10% Attack Speed (Only usable while in the air - I don\u2019t normally recommend this as it encourages bad play, being in the air leaves you a sitting duck for any hitscan.)",

Glock \u2018em down. \n\n## I DO NOT Recommend: ##\n\u274c **Crepuscular Circle** - I do not recommend taking Crepuscular Circle this early in the game. It\u2019s a fantastic power, but as a lot of people are about to get a huge power spike, Triage Unit is the extra healing needed to match it. \n\n\n# End-Game Item List #\nThis is the default list of items you should aim for. Please do the math and make sure you\u2019re getting the best bang for your buck with the cash you have.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f **Blessed Boosters** - Best repositioning/survival tool. Take it before you regret it.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f **Eye of the Spider** - 25% Weapon Power, this is huge.\n\n\ud83d\udc89**Amari\u2019s Antidote** - 15% Weapon Power (30% Weapon power when healing someone below half), excellent item.\n\n\ud83d\udeaa **The Closer** - 20% Weapon Power, an excellent stat item.\n\n\ud83d\udee9\ufe0f **Booster Jets** - 20% Attack Speed + 20% ground speed for 2 sec after you land your GA, this is your main source of Attack Speed, try to get this sooner rather than later.\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f **Chain Evoker** - 5% Damage Boost increase + 15% Damage Boost to your Ultimate Charge. If a dps is hard carrying your game, get this item sooner rather than later.\n\n## I DO NOT Recommend: ##\n\u274c **Caduceus Ex (10,000)** - While its staff range is useful, it\u2019s only a 10% weapon power increase. If you are struggling with positioning and staying close to your team whilst also being safe, consider using it, but be aware you may be hurting yourself in the long run.\n\n\u274c **Hardlight Accelerator (11,000)** - 10% CD Reduction + 10% Weapon Power (Possibly 25% Weapon Power). I do not recommend this item as it encourages wasting GA whilst the Closer is a more reliable item.\n\n\u274c **Vanadium Injection (10,000)** - 50 Shields + Little bit of everything when at 100% Ult. I do not recommend this because holding onto Valkyries in the Stadium is really bad. You charge Valkyrie so fast there is no reason not to wait. You should be building one per fight.",
