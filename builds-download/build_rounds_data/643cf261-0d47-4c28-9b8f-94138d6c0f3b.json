This item will be your best and only defensive item from Round 3 onwards.\n\nNotice how we didnt go full AP with  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) ? That's because our budget is 11.5k and we want to keep our  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) .

Its really good especially since at this point in the game people arent building survival items yet (except for tanks of course) and it also heals your allies with an AP ratio so we can focus on AP instead of Weapon Power for our torpedos to deal even MORE damage!\n\nAlso, since we have so many ability casts,  [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) becomes BROKEN on Juno!

In this round our budget is 29.500$ on an average performance, which means we could either get 20% more AP with  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) and 25 armor + 25 hp, OR buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429).\n\n50 HP is no laugh matter, but we already have  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) carrying our survivability.\nAnd while 20% AP means 5 more damage on every  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) procc and 17 more damage on our torpedos,  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) still gives us more damage.\nHere's the math: People by Round 4 have an average of ~280 HP, your primary fire is a burst of many little instances of weapon damage so on a single left-click you should be able to procc  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) its 3 times for 9% of the target's HP as damage. If we shoot your average enemy of 280 max hp, we are dealing 25.2 extra damage after every ability. So instead of dealing extra 5 damage like with building 20% AP, we'll be dealing extra 25. This, on pair with  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) means you are dealing 60.2 extra damage after every Glide Boost, after every Torpedo, after every Hyper Ring. Its just SO much better than going for a full AP torpedo only build, or  [Stinger](item_e9d0d530-d620-4e74-a34d-38cdebfeb9a4) on Round 3 as the previous version of the build was doing.\n\nFun fact! If you shoot a tank like reinhardt with around 700 HP, you will be dealing extra 98 damage on your left-clicks after every ability! So just farm damage shooting tanks now if you want!\n\nAlso, there's an argument for Cybervenom here at Round 4. If you analyze that your biggest obstacle to win the round is an insane ammount of heals comming from the enemy team, aka when you are against two main healers such as Mercy+Moira for example, then this isnt such a bad idea to take now. This doesnt mean every time they run 2 main healers you go Cybervenom, its just an option you have that you'll do maybe 10~15% of the time.",

        "notes": "And finally, if you havent wont by this point, its cause you lack survivability, so we'll take  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) and  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) . Hyper Ring now gives you and your team 100 Overhealth, and every time you use an ability you will start regenerating shields.\n\nIf you have a competent team, you can take  [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) which will make more impact than  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) could in that last round.\n\nHope the build helped! Its been a ton of fun to grind her on Stadium! ~u~ peace! 3",
