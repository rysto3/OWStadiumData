This item will be your best and only defensive item from Round 3 onwards.\n\nNotice how we didnt go full AP with  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) ?

The extra 25 shields means 12.5 more Overhealth on  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) , and its passive is still really good in this stage of the game.\nGoing for 20% AP isnt very reliable yet since our only AP procc are our torpedos, so to deal more consistent damage, which means more cash for next round, we'll buy  [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) first on this Round 2.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, before the nerfs we used to rush PulStar Destroyers with a Power Playbook, but now with the reduced 15% AP on Pulstar Destroyers that only nets us 115.5 damage on our torpedos against just building 40% AP that'll net us 119 damage on our torpedos, while also have extra cash to buy ability lifesteal and raw AP working towards our healing on torpedos as well (that the extra 20 on Pulstar doesnt provide).",

If we shoot your average enemy of 280 max hp, we are dealing 25.2 extra damage after every ability. So instead of dealing extra 5 damage like with building 20% AP, we'll be dealing extra 25. This, on pair with  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) means you are dealing 60.2 extra damage after every Glide Boost, after every Torpedo, after every Hyper Ring. Its just SO much better than going for a full AP torpedo only build, or  [Stinger](item_e9d0d530-d620-4e74-a34d-38cdebfeb9a4) on Round 3 as the previous version of the build was doing.\n\nFun fact! If you shoot a tank like reinhardt with around 700 HP, you will be dealing extra 98 damage on your left-clicks after every ability! So just farm damage shooting tanks now if you want!\n\nAlso, there's an argument for Cybervenom here at Round 4. If you analyze that your biggest obstacle to win the round is an insane ammount of heals comming from the enemy team, aka when you are against two main healers such as Mercy+Moira for example, then this isnt such a bad idea to take now. This doesnt mean every time they run 2 main healers you go Cybervenom, its just an option you have that you'll do maybe 10~15% of the time.",

We can harass the enemy tank since we deal hp% damage and have anti-heals, but we can also kill squishies, all while being really hard to hit and having a bunch of overheals to defend ourselves!\n\nThis is the peak of the build.",

        "notes": "And finally, if you havent wont by this point, its cause you lack survivability, so we'll take  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) and  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) . Hyper Ring now gives you and your team 100 Overhealth, and every time you use an ability you will start regenerating shields.\n\nIf you have a competent team, you can take  [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) which will make more impact than  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) could in that last round.\n\nHope the build helped! Its been a ton of fun to grind her on Stadium! ~u~ peace! 3",
