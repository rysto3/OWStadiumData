The main reason I say that is because you typically get more cash from healing than damage boost, and Mercy is actually a viable healer in this mode compared to the main game.\n\nFor items, nothing too fancy in the first round, just get your typical starting items. I like to get  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) and  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) just to heal as much as I can.\nThe remaining $1500, I like to get  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da). You can also go for  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) if you prefer, but from my personal experience,  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) lets me get back into the fight earlier after getting forced out, so I like it more.\n\nGameplay loop is you prioritize healing as much as you can to generate cash while weaving in damage boost when you can but don't worry about it if you need to heal more. Try to heal from a safe distance as much as you can to stay alive and keep generating cash.",

This is the core part of the build because you will be buying a lot of weapon power, making your self-heal incredibly strong. This way, you can build a lot of weapon power to continue building cash while also being very tanky without committing to a lot of the survival items. And as we all know, the longer you stay alive, the more cash you make.\n\nFor items, try getting [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) and [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f) if you can. [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) will help you keep the tank a lot better. If you have enough money, you can also get the [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f) as well. I would say this over [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) if you can for the better weapon power.\n\nFor the gameplay loop, you do the same, heal from a safe place. But now, when you need healing, you just try to keep your healing beam attached to 2 people with [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) at all times to make sure you get maximum self-healing.",

        "notes": "At this point, your power choice is quite free, but for me I like to get either [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) or  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb).  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) will be a more versatile choice, especially since your healing is very strong at this point, Valkyrie can genuinely feel like a defensive ult. However, if we have a Reinhart, Orisa, or D.va, then I like going [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) to keep them up better. The amplified healing will also help you stay alive with [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1).\n\nFor items, at this point, I like getting [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) since it works really well with [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) since you outheal the delayed damage quite easily and it has a bit of weapon power. With this, you will be incredibly tanky, it's funny. If you are feeling bold or you're playing with mobile teammates, you could also go for [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) for the longer beam range as well.\n\nIf you choose [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) circle, focus on healing everyone to build your ult as soon as possible. You should be able to get it quicker than anyone else if your team is taking damage consistently. If you build it fast enough, you should be able to just win outright with just your ult. Feel free to pull out your glock to shoot at this time. Try going for their support if you can.\n\nIf you choose [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4), then it's the same thing. You just bounce around everywhere, healing 2 people at all times. To trigger the amplified healing, you don't need to GA all the way to the target. You can also just tab your GA and let go to trigger it without actually putting yourself in harm's way.",

Gameplay tip is the same as the one on round 5, you will build your extremely fast from the high healing output and [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb), which you should get first and be able to win the fight with it. If you chose [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb), then I like going [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) just for the more frequent ult. \n\nFor the last item slot, you can choose between [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) for more healing or [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) to be more tanky. If you want maximum healing (which would also let you heal yourself more and be tankier), then you can also ditch [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) and get both  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) and [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) for the weapon power.\n\nWhatever you choose, the core items should include [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5), [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448), [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8), and [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124).",
