        "notes": "## Power \u26a1\nTake [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900) to make Genji's quick melee into a serious threat and lay the groundwork for the build to evolve in the next rounds.\n\n## Items \u2694\ufe0f\nTake the three items that enhance quick melee.\n\n## Playstyle\nClassic genji playstyle, but try to use quick melee more often in between attacks to heal yourself and deal extra damage. Using quick melee multiple times in a row in a 1v1 can be a viable strategy sometimes as well, especially if you are both low and you can finish them off with a couple melees while keeping yourself alive with the heals. Melee lifesteal also lets you be a little more aggressive with your ult.\n\n## Loadout Damage Numbers\n* \ud83e\udd1c Quick melee will deal \ud83d\udca268 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a59.\n* \ud83d\udde1 Dragonblade attacks will deal \ud83d\udca2116 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a58.\n\n## Alternative Build: Burst Damage\n[Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168) could be a consideration instead of [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900) as the first power to try to go for a burst damage build (with [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) instead of [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)), but the self healing 59 every quick melee plus the lifesteal added to Dragonblade gets more consistent value in my opinion\n\n___\n## Dragonblade Notes\nBade attacks are considered melee, but not quick melee. This means, for example, that they trigger [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7), but not [Siphon Gloves](item_099f8177-c2a4-4e13-b321-99349f8b1eb7). They work with [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900)\u2019s melee lifesteal, but not the quick melee damage increase. [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) melee damage bonus applies, but they cannot crit.\n\n[Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d) projectiles deal half of the total damage that Dragonblade melee attacks deal. Yes, that means these projectiles are boosted by melee damage bonuses. These projectiles however, count as ranged attacks so they can only lifesteal from weapon lifesteal.\n\n## Attack Speed\nAttack speed works with shuriken attacks, quick melee, and Dragonblade.\n\n## Item Notes\n* [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) 10% bonus critical damage does not affect quick melee crits, but the vision after crits does apply to quick melee crits.\n* [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) works with quick melee and blade.\n* [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) armor piercing works with everything on all heroes as far as I have seen.\n* [El-sa'ka Supressor](item_b4298dd9-9b93-461f-a2e0-843402667100) healing reduction does not apply to melee crits.\n* [Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) can restore ammo from damage dealt to barriers from [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d) projectiles, but this is useless.\n* [Weapon Jammer](item_72386db6-753e-413d-aa2a-f1389842f47f) seems to steal attack speed when attacking with Dragonblade, but not quick melee. However, I found this difficult to test and I could be wrong.\n\n# Conclusions\nWeapon power is extremely valuable since it works with shurikens, blade, and quick melee. Even if building for blade damage, it is not worth it to build ability power even though you can get more ability power and therefore more blade damage per credit spent. The only reason to build ability power is in dash focused builds, but since dash is on an eight cooldown with only 50 base damage, going for a dash focused build does not seem like a good idea. Especially since if you put all your credits into ability power, it is very hard to finish off kills with shurikens and quick melee to reset your dash cooldown.\n\nSince melee damage bonus and weapon power scale multiplicatively for quick melee damage, each point of melee damage bonus makes weapon power more effective and vice versa. This makes melee damage bonus a valuable asset rather than being strictly worse than weapon power.\n\n# P.S.\nBig shoutout to Edamame\u2019s \u201cBetter Stadium Practice Range!\u201d code P05GM which made testing damage numbers a lot easier.\n\n*While you were partying, I studied the blade.*",

        "notes": "## Items \u2694\ufe0f\n[Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) and [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) are both viable options for round 2. [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) has more offensive potential whereas [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) is the more defensive build. If you are confident you can get value from the quick melee crit, go with the aggressive build. I think it has a higher ceiling so I am choosing it as the default build. Let's compare the numbers below assuming you also have exactly enough credits for [Siphon Gloves](item_099f8177-c2a4-4e13-b321-99349f8b1eb7) and [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0).\n\n| | Quick Melee Damage | Quick Melee Lifesteal + Heal |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) | 78.8 | 64.4 |\n| [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) crit | 118.1 | 84.1 |\n| [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) | 74.6 | 79.8 |\n\nAs you can see, [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) gives the potential to do significantly more damage while not lacking in the lifesteal department, whereas [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) gives more healing when attacking from the front and additionally provides armor and movespeed.\n\n### Poverty Plan \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to buy common items on top of the epic item you chose, that\u2019s fine. If you can\u2019t even afford one epic, get [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) and keep as many common items from round 1 as you can.\n\n## Playstyle\nWith [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) you need to get value from the backstab crit. A typical hard commitment would be dashing through a target and using quick melee on their back before they can turn around, then alternate shuriken and melee to finish them off. Other ways to get value from the melee crit is sneaking behind people or meleeing targets who are running away from you.\n\n## Loadout Damage Numbers\n* \ud83e\udd1c Quick melee will deal \ud83d\udca279 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a64.\n* \ud83e\udd1c\u2757\ufe0f Quick melee crit will deal \ud83d\udca2118 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a84.\n* \ud83d\udde1 Dragonblade attacks will deal \ud83d\udca2143 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a72.",

It synergizes perfectly with [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900)\u2019s lifesteal and the melee boosting items you already want to buy.\n\n## Items \u2694\ufe0f\nIdeally, purchase the epic item you didn\u2019t choose last round. If you can\u2019t afford that, [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) plus a bunch of common items will do.\n\n### Bait \ud83c\udfa3\n\nI have seen a few guides saying that [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) is a great item for melee Genji, but I am not sure why. The armor reduction literally just increases melee damage by 3.5. If you were planning on pumping shurikens into their tank, it would be a decent item, giving 3.5 more damage shuriken, but that is not the plan with this build. For quick melee attacks, once you have [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900) and [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca), you actually get more melee damage from acquiring 20% weapon power than you do from [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) while attacking enemies with armor. Therefore, I think [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) plus [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) for 7000 credits is generally better than [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) for 9000 credits.\n\n## Playstyle\nYou still want to be getting behind your targets either with Swift Strike or sneaking behind people. Now you have an additional tool for finishing off targets. With the exact recommended loadout, your dragon blade is doing 159.5 damage, so you can basically finish off any squishy target that you gen below half health with [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168). Be warned that if you just double tap your Deflect hotkey it will not immediately cancel since it has a 0.27 second minimum duration. To strike as quickly as possible, spam your deflect hotkey or learn the timing. When using Deflect defensively, try to also slash an easy target if possible, as it lifesteals a lot and it triggers [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7)\u2019s buff.\n\n## Loadout Damage Numbers\n* \ud83e\udd1c Quick melee will deal \ud83d\udca285 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a60.\n* \ud83e\udd1c\u2757\ufe0f Quick melee crit will deal \ud83d\udca2128 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a81.\n* \ud83d\udde1 Dragonblade attacks will deal \ud83d\udca2159 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a96.\n*Including [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) healing*",

After this, the build is flexible. By default I recommend [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054), which is a great offensive item giving valuable attack speed and movement speed, synergizing well with the melee strategy. For defensive options, [Anti-Beam Coating](item_1ab73e1c-aaa1-4026-89cd-68404db7fd93) is necessary in some games and [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016) is a good generic option.\n\n### Poverty Plan \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\nFirst priority is buying [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca) and [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7). If you are getting destroyed by both Zarya and Moira, prioritize [Anti-Beam Coating](item_1ab73e1c-aaa1-4026-89cd-68404db7fd93), but otherwise buy as much weapon power as you can. You can simply replace [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) with [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) and not lose out on very much.\n\n## Playstyle\n\nNothing really changes this round, you just have more damage and/or survivability.\n\n## Loadout damage numbers\n* \ud83e\udd1c Quick melee will deal \ud83d\udca297 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a67.\n* \ud83e\udd1c\u2757\ufe0f Quick melee crit will deal \ud83d\udca2146 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a91.\n* \ud83d\udde1 Dragonblade attacks will deal \ud83d\udca2176 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a106.\n*Including [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) healing*\n\nExample combo:\n* Dash through them dealing 50 damage\n* Perform a quick melee crit dealing 145.8 damage\n* Secondary fire for three shuriken body shots dealing 97.2 damage\n* [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168) for 176 damage\n* Total: 469 damage!!\nThis is enough to kill most DPS or supports as long as they aren\u2019t getting significant healing, plus you lifesteal a lot and can reset your dash to get out so you should be pretty safe.",

        "notes": "## Power \u26a1\n[Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca) is the obvious next choice for this build. The healing it provides pushes Genji\u2019s survivability over the top and makes you significantly tankier. Remember, the overhealth from critical hits works with melee crits!\n\n## Items \u2694\ufe0f\n[Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) is an amazing item with this build since it gives the most raw weapon power, which we know is the most valuable stat. You could consider [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce), but remember the 10% bonus does not work with quick melee crits and the [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) 10% bonus weapon power against low health enemies works with quick melee and Dragonblade. If you are a Genji master who will hit all your shuriken headshots, you can go with [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce), but for the rest of us, I recommend [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b).\n\n## Playstyle\nAdding [Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca) to your kit doesn\u2019t really change the playstyle, it just gives you more survivability so that you can keep being aggressive as the opponents are also scaling up and becoming more of a threat.\n\n## Loadout damage numbers\n* \ud83e\udd1c Quick melee will deal \ud83d\udca2117 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a78.\n* \ud83e\udd1c\u2757\ufe0f Quick melee crit will deal \ud83d\udca2176 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a107.\n* \ud83d\udde1 Dragonblade attacks will deal \ud83d\udca2204 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a121.\n*Including [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) healing*\n\n## Alternative Build: \ud83e\udd77 Aura Farming Dragonblade Ninja\nIf you have enough aura, you will already know that [Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca) is kinda lame. Why would you need to heal yourself more if you can just kill all the opponents? [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d), on the other hand, brings your damage to the next level adding range to [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168) and turning your ultimate into a quintuple kill machine. The problem with this build is that investing too much in your ultimate means you aren\u2019t as much of a consistent threat throughout the round. You can mitigate this problem by purchasing [Transference Delta](item_4bcdd047-90a2-43af-8d57-160cb21022ee) and [Enduring Edge](item_6a68babb-9434-42a0-8374-5b5973e8b6db) to significantly increase the uptime of Dragonblade. However, you would have to sacrifice a lot to buy them this round, so I would advise waiting until the next round to do that.\n\n### Warning\nThe [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d)\u2019s build can be very dangerous against Orisa with [Spynstem Update](item_9fbbe756-5dd6-44f6-abd8-a8355f0be2b5) or even an opposing Genji. A volley of your slow moving projectiles can easily be deflected back to you and your team, killing multiple team members. Don\u2019t ask how I know.\n\nNot worth going for this build into certain lineups. D.Va can also eat the projectiles, but that\u2019s not as big of a problem.\n\n### Alternate Build Playstyle\nEven though your blade now has a long range projectile component to it, you still want to be using the melee attack when possible since you have melee lifesteal and the melee attacks do more damage. The main benefit of this build is that you can use the projectiles to get eliminations to reset your dash cooldown to close the gap on someone and continue using the melee attacks. This is especially good against teams with lots of slippery targets that can evade you during your ult.\n\nEven when meleeing, you still launch a projectile, so try to line up your targets to hit multiple opponents at once. Keep in mind, while playing in third person, if you attack a target that is very close to you, your aim will be adjusted to account for the difference in position between your crosshair and your hero\u2019s face (where the attacks originate). Unfortunately this makes the piercing projectile go in an unintended direction when attacking a close up enemy with Dragonblade. You can easily replicate this in the practice range if you are unsure what I mean. I prefer playing Genji in third person, but first person might be worth it if you trying to get the absolute maximum potential from [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d).",

It allows you to get even more value from the lifesteal you already have by converting it to overhealth. It gives a nice boost to lifesteal while also giving you some more juicy weapon power.

You can sell [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) and skip out on [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643). Yes, you will have less self healing, but you will be able to farm clips for your highlight reel and you can just blame your supports if you die.",

        "notes": "## Power \u26a1\nIf you haven\u2019t won the game yet, now is your chance to have your fun with [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d). The previous alternate build and the mainline build converge at this point. If you already took [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d), I suggest going back for [Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca) now.\n\n## Items \u2694\ufe0f\nPick up [Transference Delta](item_4bcdd047-90a2-43af-8d57-160cb21022ee) and [Enduring Edge](item_6a68babb-9434-42a0-8374-5b5973e8b6db). This combo makes your ults come more often and extends their duration significantly (up to 10 seconds from 6 seconds). Buy [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) because it is the best attack speed item and the movement speed helps you stick to targets after dashing. You can sell [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) because the heal kinda falls off at this point and the rest of the items are too important.\n\n### Poverty Plan \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8\nYes, this build is a little expensive. You can skip [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) for [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054), [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a), or even [Anti-Beam Coating](item_1ab73e1c-aaa1-4026-89cd-68404db7fd93) if it is a good game for it.\n\n## Playstyle\nYou can still assassinate people with your main combo and backstab melee crits are still powerful, but you can see that the loadout damage numbers are slightly reduced. Your damage per second is about the same since you have more attack speed. Your main goal now is to farm ults and use them at important moments since Dragonblade is super powerful at this point. Depending on the game, Dragonblade can basically solo a team fight, so try not to stack your ult with your teammates\u2019 ultimates if you don\u2019t need to.\n\n## Loadout Damage Numbers\nThe healing numbers are down, but they are now fully instant instead of including [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7).\n* \ud83e\udd1c Quick melee will deal \ud83d\udca2108 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a54.\n* \ud83e\udd1c\u2757\ufe0f Quick melee crit will deal \ud83d\udca2163 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a82 plus \u2747\ufe0f41 overhealth.\n* \ud83d\udde1 Dragonblade attacks will deal \ud83d\udca2198 damage and heal for \ud83d\udc9a128.\n\n## Alternative Build: Mr. Consistent\nIf the enemies can reflect projectiles or you do not want to be overly reliant on your ult, go for the alternate build with [Hashimoto\u2019s Bane](item_03650ff3-917e-45fe-aeed-11c0f24c0eba) instead. This build maximizes dps, sustain, and burst, but sacrifices on the flashy plays you can make.\n\nFor this build, you will want your inventory to be the following:\n* [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48)\n* [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b)\n* [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce)\n* [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca)\n* [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643)\n* [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7)\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford this, swap [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) for [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a).\n\nExample combo:\n* Dash through them dealing 55 damage\n* Perform a quick melee crit dealing 188.325 damage\n* Secondary fire for five shuriken body shots dealing 209.25 damage\n* [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168) for 225.5 damage\n* Total: 678.075 damage!!",
