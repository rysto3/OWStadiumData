        "notes": "This is the big Round. We can finally start playing our Build and get that Transcendence-Value!\n\n## Power\n[Soul Control](item_051aca60-1044-4184-bbbf-5aad8b12592a) is our most important power. It gives much more control over how long we want to use Transcendence.\nIdeally, you'll have Trans in every fight (or even multiple times per fight!).\n\n## Items\nThere are two big Transcendence-Items we want to get, you can decide which one you like to get first this round.\n\n[Mondatta's Mantra](item_96d3b160-3c50-4768-90e4-c7005c98ce43) is the first, and my personal Choice. \nIt makes you quite tanky after using Trans, giving you lots of survivabilty to play more aggressively and farm Ultcharge.\n\n[Mind Shaper](item_c902b4f2-1151-4ec8-8dcd-f55144a45eb7) is the other choice.\nYou should take it if your team has many important Cooldowns on which they rely on. (Some examples are Zarya-Bubble, Queens Shout, Orisa-cooldowns, both of Mei's cooldowns, Helix-Rocket, Suzu, Biotic-Grenade, Resurrection, Amp or Hyper-Ring)\n\nTry to use Trans with this Item if you feel like your team needs the Cooldown-Reduction.\n\nAlthough it is less flashy than the previous items, you should also get [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) and keep it as long as possible.\nIt is very efficient on Heroes with lots of Shields (like Zen), as the Armor is always used up after the Shield-HP. This makes you keep the DMG-reduction for longer and gives a nice boost to survivability.\nThe only time you should not use this item is when the Enemy team is very Ability-Power based.\n\nIf you have some Cash left, fill out your remaining slots with the optional items, most importantly [Satya's Solution](item_1710519d-210a-4b92-b9ed-234abf6ade2c) \n\n## Playstyle\nWith our new power [Soul Control](item_051aca60-1044-4184-bbbf-5aad8b12592a), our playstyle changes significantly.\nTry to farm lots of Ultcharge early to get the first Transcendence online.\nAs soon as you got it, try to use it for key moments when you anticipate lots of damage on your team. Look out for big Cooldowns or Ults of the enemy team and get as much Value out of your Ult as you can.\n\nIdeally, you only want to use Transcendence in small bursts. Only hold it as long as you really need and cancel it as soon as possible. You'll get as much as 65% Ultcharge back, which will make the next Ult come quickly.\n\nIf you still have [Charged Plating](item_b8ca58e7-6ae2-40ee-8618-fe2f32315295), you can maximize its buff as well.",
