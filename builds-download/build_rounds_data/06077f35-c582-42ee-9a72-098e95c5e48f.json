        "notes": "# Season 17 Updates\n**[S17 UPDATE]**: From my experience testing this build in the current (at the time of writing this) season, there is potential merit in running [Precarious Potency](item_b1305ee6-3027-4131-8797-dcbeb68e3953) as your R1 power. Running Precarious Potency will help with credit generation in the early-game, allowing you to quickly get the items you need by R3 and pick Multiball. By doing this, you're essentially switching your R1 and R5/7 powers.\n\n# Round 1 Power\n[Cross-Orbal](item_e567bb63-527f-4c72-8ba1-dc59be1a0dc1) will be your first Power.\n\nYou may think about choosing [Multiball](item_5d0e4135-f4e1-42fb-991a-417643064560), but in the early rounds, Cross-Orbal tends to perform better. You'll pick Multiball later.\n\n# Round 1 Items\nRealistically, the MAIN item you need to get is  [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418). Everything else here is purely up to how you want to play in the early game.\n\nI typically run [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418), [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0), and pick a third item based on context (enemy team comp, my team comp, what I want to get in the moment, etc.)",

One of the strongest perks for Orb-focused Moira builds.\n\n [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6): If you can also afford this, purchase this alongside Smart Orbs. It's good early-game AP for your orbs/ultimate.\n\n## What if I can't afford Smart Orbs & Nano Cola?\nIf you can't afford both, pick up [Smart Orbs](item_47f5985c-9b63-40d2-938b-63a22154b9be). If you have enough leftover for another blue item, pick either [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) or [Multi-Tool](item_5ba8d94e-f2f3-44b7-8773-025fc6ed7c56) based on whether you want more weapon damage or cooldown reduction. If you are playing more pure Orb/Ultimate, pick **Multi-Tool**. If you are using some form of right-click power, pick **Custom Stock**. Fill/replace with greens as needed.\n\n## What about purples?\nIf you're able to purchase Smart Orbs & Nano Cola all in round two, you're already in a good spot. Do **NOT** skip Smart Orbs for a purple at this stage - or ever. If you earn high credits, you'll be able to purchase purples in Round 3.\nYou won't be able to purchase both Smart Orbs and a purple item, so take that into consideration.\n\nIf you absolutely want to buy a purple item in Round 2, here are some you can consider:\n\n- [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4): If you've been using your ult and want it to charge faster, grab this.\n- [Extendrils](item_138e73a2-6915-4ffc-bd89-029a85bf94b8): I actually wouldn't ever buy this round 2, but if you want to, go ahead.\n- [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98): Good (and necessary in the final build) to slow the enemy team, keep them clumped together, or to chase down low-health enemies.\n- [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505): If their team comp naturally has healers, or if your enemy is building lifesteal, that you want to debuff early: [Junker Queen](hero_4794d288-27d9-49e0-a1dd-ffe0f4de3ab1), [Mercy](hero_0e213bfc-3ca9-49c6-9036-e7f344b752da), [Reaper](hero_0449752f-1c58-487b-b9a0-ca727d784457), [Soldier: 76](hero_e1ac7ef5-4648-4998-b8b0-9e3da3e60546)",

        "notes": "# Round 3 Powers\nFor round 3, you'll want to pick up [Multiball](item_5d0e4135-f4e1-42fb-991a-417643064560) now. Your usefulness as a Utility Moira\u2122 will start becoming apparent now.\n\n## Substitute Powers\nRealistically, you should never pick any other power over Multiball. Your optional powers will come during Rounds 5 & 7 based on the flow of your specific game.\nCheck the notes at the top of this guide to see optional powers you can pick from based on your potential needs.\n\n# Round 3 Items\nThis is where you start buying purple items. Your goal is to build [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) and [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) as fast as possible so you can become Utility Moira\u2122, but depending on the match's situation, you could pick up the following:\n- [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98): As stated earlier, helps with orb upkeep on enemies, keeps them clumped together, or to chase down low-health heroes. You will pick this eventually, but if you want this over Cybervenom now, buy it.\n- [Extendrils](item_138e73a2-6915-4ffc-bd89-029a85bf94b8): Your orbs will work at farther ranges from their target, triggering all of your utility (smart orbs, cybervenom, liquid nitrogen, etc.) at greater distances.\n- [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce): Raw AP output. Greatly increases orb healing and damage. This is a viable pickup round 3/4 if you're doing well. I recommend this as part of your final build.\n- [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4): For more ult uses per round. Goes really well with [Coalegion](item_ff9adeb1-362c-46a4-80ef-4e0eb07479cc).\n- [Coalegion](item_ff9adeb1-362c-46a4-80ef-4e0eb07479cc): I wouldn't get this without [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) mainly because you most likely won't be able to use your ult more than once in the early rounds. If you are, then this is a good substitute pick.\n- [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b): Special thanks to Yunec for pointing out this item! This is a good pick in-between to generate more AP if you don't run Champion's Kit.\n\nDo **NOT** sell Smart Orbs to buy more purple items or your first purple item. If you have to go [Smart Orbs](item_47f5985c-9b63-40d2-938b-63a22154b9be) and  [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6), do that first. But typically, you should have these in round two and starting buying purples in round 3 unless you and/or your team did not win/get enough points to buy a purple. In this case, pick situational blue items.",
