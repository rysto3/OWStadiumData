Your usefulness as a Utility Moira\u2122 will start becoming apparent now.\n\n## Substitute Powers\n [Optimal Overflow](item_9d85ca48-b27a-435a-8ef9-247440e0f97d): If you see yourself expending a lot of your biotic power, you can take this instead, but I wouldn't recommend it as your orbs should be able to upkeep healing/damage as needed.\n\n [Phantasm](item_21ed9c3d-7a54-438f-9188-f21fd7a7dbfb): You will pick this later, but if for some reason you need this early, pick it. In most situations, you would **NEVER** pick this over Multiball this early in the game.\n\n# Round 3 Items\nThis is where you start buying purple items. Your goal is to build [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) and [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) as fast as possible so you can become Utility Moira\u2122, but depending on the match's situation, you could pick up the following:\n- [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98): As stated earlier, helps with orb upkeep on enemies, keeps them clumped together, or to chase down low-health heroes. You will pick this eventually, but if you want this over Cybervenom now, buy it.\n- [Extendrils](item_138e73a2-6915-4ffc-bd89-029a85bf94b8): If you can buy this and and item like Cybervenom or Liquid Nitrogen together, would be optimal round 3 build.\nIf you can buy a combination like Extendrils and Cybervenom/Liquid Nitrogen, that would be the optimal build. Do **NOT** sell Smart Orbs to make this happen.\n\n## Alternative Items\n- [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce): If you really just want raw AP - your final build won't be able to hold this if you follow this exactly, but this is good for extra damage/healing output.\n- [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4): For more ult uses per round\n- [Coalegion](item_ff9adeb1-362c-46a4-80ef-4e0eb07479cc): I wouldn't get this without [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) mainly because you most likely won't be able to use your ult more than once in the early rounds. If you are, then this is a good substitute pick.",
