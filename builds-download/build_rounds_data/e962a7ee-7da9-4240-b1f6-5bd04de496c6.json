Continuously rotating abilities is how you're going to be effective here. Make sure you don't just spam all abilities at the same time, and then you're walking around doing nothing until they come back up because that will get you killed. In these earlier rounds give a few seconds in between abilities (just use primary fire) if you need to. And DONT BE AFRAID OF TAKING DAMAGE! Your abilities are all going to heal you.\n\nA lot of these Orisa builds ignore  [Siphonic Spear](item_82c46448-08f2-4664-842c-c04d3120369a) but returning 10% of your health on that short of a cooldown is incredibly powerful.

With the whole concept of this build, you're taking massive damage but trying to out-heal it, and this perk instantly gives half that damage back to you as shields when you finish using Fortify.\n\nSince you get that huge buff to Fortify from your new Power, we want to build on that here. Purchase [Efi\u2019s Theorem](item_609c4cb6-a232-4e08-a11f-5252d40382be) this round. Don't sell your blues here but feel free to sell any greens you need to afford this first purple item.\n\nWorst case scenario: You're currently point starved and can't afford this purple, I could consider selling [Solar Regenergy](item_b03b2c68-d3e3-413a-a9b8-3385149ba9b8) to afford it, then just grabbing whatever else you can afford.\n\nPlaystyle changes for the round: you may be able to start adjusting your rotation a bit based on how long Fortify will now last you. Fortify just got a 50% duration boost from [Efi\u2019s Theorem](item_609c4cb6-a232-4e08-a11f-5252d40382be) so use your other cooldowns before and after Fortify.\n\nOptional Items: [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) is a viable option from here on out when you have extra slots. Your first purple gives you ability lifesteal, so it makes sense to power up your abilities with this item if you can.",

An extra 35% duration to Javelin Spin which can completely stop you from taking damage helps you take up more of that downtime.\n\nPlaystyle Changes: you'll have to keep making adjustments to your ability rotation as your cooldown timers get shorter. Keep in mind the time it takes for them to come back up to use again. Javelin Throw is now your shortest cooldown, so you should be trying to fit it in between the other two. Ex: Throw - Spin - Throw - Fortify - Throw - Spin....\n\nOptional Items: If you're playing into Zarya & Moira (Mei might even count as a beam, I don't remember) and struggling, you can consider [Refraction Tiles](item_16e4b34e-d8dd-4cbd-85dc-ff6370cca092) as a replacement for one of your blues to help you with not taking as much damage from their Beam damage. \n\n[Multi-Tool](item_5ba8d94e-f2f3-44b7-8773-025fc6ed7c56) is another really good option in this build. It could be considered depending on your matchup and how you're being targeted. If you need more help in your ability rotation, consider throwing this in there. \n\nFor whatever reason, if you're point starved and can't afford a blue 6th item, I included the three greens I would consider based on how the match is going for you. Pick which makes the most sense, they all help.",

So, taking [Factory Reset](item_d98df807-9dd6-4553-96bb-a1b49a0fe169) here allows us to do exactly that. \n\n[Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e) is the next purple we want because your Ultimate will now just become part of your rotation since you can get it VERY fast.\n\nOptional Items: We can't keep all 4 blue's this time, so you need to get rid of one of them. [Elite Rotator Cuff](item_dfba3349-64b8-4386-8eaf-15bcd1ca6b37) can be a really helpful perk if you struggle with your rotation, but personally it's not my favorite.",

        "notes": "With this build, you should be getting tons of points to buy with by the time you make it to these late rounds. For this build, round 6 is REALLy close to your build potential's ceiling.\n\n[Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448) is the first one to buy here. Another 10% cooldown reduction is going to help you start to be able to spam your way through your ability rotation, in addition to giving you more damage to pressure those squishy backline characters with.\n\n[Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) is my personal favorite next item here. Especially if the other team isn't respecting your front line pressure. As I said in Round 1 this is where they REALLY need to chose between having their entire team focus you to kill you, and if they don't you shouldn't ever die. This item gives you tons more lifesteal and damage potential to rush into their backline to get a kill (even if you use your ultimate to do it) and retreat safely back to your team. Then just repeat this over and over.\n\nNow on the other hand, when teams do actually focus you and you're not able to take Phantasmic Flux to be more aggressive  [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) is a really good option to help you prevent damage here.\n\nAs for your 6th ability, I left the previous blue items up there from last round. If you can afford another purple, grab it, otherwise just keep the blue that you're seeing the most benefit from in your matchup.",

        "notes": "Now for this Last round there are SOOO MANY options for this build. It will depend on how the enemy is playing against you.\n\nFor the 4th Power:\n\nIf the enemy is letting you walk freely around the front lines and are just klilling your team around you, I like to take [Ride with Me](item_40de0b02-ce4b-4a66-8d1c-a129af10caec). It doesn't give you anything different to do, but it allows you to keep dropping giant overhealth pools onto ALL your allies in line of sight of you and then gives them more movement speed to stay alive.\n\nIf they are focusing you (as we want them to) but your own team isn't able to capitalize on the lack of pressure on them/aren't getting any eliminations, you can take  [Spynstem Update](item_9fbbe756-5dd6-44f6-abd8-a8355f0be2b5) to instead of stop damage for a few seconds, you will just send it back. Make sure to target their supports since you may be able to eliminate them instantly. Don't waste this on sending damage onto the tank.\n\nNow, if you really don't like these two options  [Centripetal Charge](item_4c59fa91-c687-4c6d-810d-ddb79288315a) is another REALLY good option here. Not only will this let you use your Ultimate as just another part of your cooldown rotation but you can litterally burn all your cooldowns running into their backline to use your Ultimate on a support, but then instantly have your abilities back to retreat back to your team safely.\n\nAs far as your 6th item. Again, this is very situational for how they are playing, but ANY of the optional items are GREAT. If I can pick anything, my first choice is  [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d)",
