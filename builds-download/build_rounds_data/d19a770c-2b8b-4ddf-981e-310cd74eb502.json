        "notes": "Weapon power (WP) and Attack speed (AttkSpd) both increase Mercy's healing. A balanced ratio of both is theoretically best, but you'll generally focus on the combined value of both. \n [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) is pretty much interchangeable with  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6).  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) is better on longer range maps and against slower teams. [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) is better if the enemy plays fast or targets you with chip damage.\n\nRunning  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb)  first round is typically pretty bad. Even though Crep Circle does help farm cash and win battles,  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) is more consistent value with increased healing and DMG boost throughout the round. Moreover,  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) will pair well with  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) because  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) helps you build Valk, something that most other powers don't do. \n\n [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) is for Ability Power (AP) Mercy builds. It's best round 1 where it can help you push DMG boost (use the power to heal while still DMG boosting).  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) can technically be good for pocketing, and, at the extreme late game (Rounds 5-7) it can actually outscale normal builds in single-target healing. This issue with this power is how vulnerable it is to hitscan. If you aren't spamming Guardian Angel (GA) a lot, then  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) will just be significantly better overall. \n\nShorthand: (AP mercy is playable but not strong or meta)",

[Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) is harder to use when you don't have a particular player or two popping off consistently.",

[Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) is amazing even without pulling out the blaster (although it is advised).  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) is way more flexible and impactful compared to even Juno's orbital ray (crep circle also charges faster). \nTo put it simply, Crep Circle farms cash and win teamfights.\n\n [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca)  is essential. Unless your team is taking a lot of damage without a fight,  [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) gives the hugest advantage to you and your team. \n\nFrom now on you need to search for key abilities and angles to damage boost. Now that dmg boost is 35% and the ultimate charge gained is increased, it becomes an important balance between impactful dmg boost and pretty much heal botting.\n\nAlternatively, you can try to stack WP and AttckSpd; in which case you should try to buy  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124).

        "notes": "Whew! Now we finally have free will with our Power choice! But first I should just get it out of the way that [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) will lead to the biggest increase in healing at this point, especially If you're looking to replace [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) and/or [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) for survivability/utility.\n\n[Distortion](item_5557e2f2-02df-4eac-8128-0c23b71183b1) is my go-to option because it helps allies sustain, even when using DMG boost, and doesn't require resurrect to work. \n\n[Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) is, pretty objectively, the strongest option. It makes each resurrect way more impactful. Since we already picked [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb), [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) can really help turn a losing team fight/neutral fight (the fight before it really begins/someone uses an ultimate), but, with how fast-paced stadium can be, resurrect takes a long time and can be extremely risky (but that depends on the map and how the enemy team plays). I would recommend getting [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) and replacing [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) with [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448) for more cool down. \n\n [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) is great for pocketing tanks/helping them. This can be especially good if you notice the enemy running tankbuster builds on Mei and Reaper, a scary enemy tank shredding your tank, or you pick up on a lot of %-based damage items like [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) or [Volskaya Ordnance](item_396c0970-daa8-47e3-8049-e65f03fe5cec) (that second one is pretty unpopular, so I'm not sure if it's even good -.-). \nTLDR: good for pocketing tank, DPS and support usually get shredded too quickly for this power to matter; it's also a bit difficult to use (easier with [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5))\n\n [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) is helpful for survivability. Be warned!!! In my experience this power is not crazy impactful outside of Valk. Even with [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) and lots of healing, it's not meant to make you invincible. BUT, it does get better in the late-game with [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) and  [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) to reduce the influx of burst damage. \n\n [Battle Medic](item_ccd0edff-4d57-4ac2-83a7-bab6ff0ffb2f) actually increases your healing during Valk (only if you have [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb)). I am aware that the Devs said that it doesn't, but in-game testing says different. This healing increase is somewhat noticeable, but you should really only pick this power if you plan on blastering a lot (and succeeding). It's not META, but it gives a ton of carry potential.",

Again, [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) can help with survivability and scales well with [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) (which will make it easier to take burst DMG but really only 1-2 instances at a time bcs the enemies will do a LOT of damage by round 7). \nI put in a VERY high healing build, but each item in the optional list is VERY good for survivability. In late game, a lot of Cassidy and Genji players become really problematic with a ton of burst damage which will make your healing focused build irrelevant. There's also Moira and Juno with anti-heals and slows that make Mercy worse. This is why we need survivability to enable teamfight-saving resurrects and contest/battle mercy during Valk. \n\nI would suggest getting rid of [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) first in place of [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5) if you feel that you'll be able to evade fire and pull off a lot of rezzes. Otherwise, [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) will be better for slowing down the burst damage you take.\n\nIf you're not finding a lot of opportunities to Rez, try picking up [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) and [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) for an even tanker build that can take on riskier resurrects (not too risky, I mean against roughly 200 incoming DMG)",
