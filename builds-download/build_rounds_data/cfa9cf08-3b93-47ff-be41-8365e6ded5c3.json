Every bit helps early on.\n\n- Ammo Reserves (20% Max Ammo): Synergizes directly with Power Man on the Run, giving you even more bullets to work with before needing to reload.\n\n- Power Playbook (10% Ability Power): A small boost to your Helix Rocket damage, contributing to early pressure.\n\nFocus: Establish a strong base of sustained damage. Use Sprint liberally to reposition and replenish ammo while continuously firing at the enemy tank or other priority targets. Helix Rocket should be used offensively whenever it's off cooldown.",

It turns your Pulse Rifle into a true tank-melting weapon.\n\nSell: Nano Cola (Assuming you picked Amari's Antidote earlier; if you chose differently, sell the least impactful item from your current build).\n\nItem: \n- Champion\u2019s Kit (40% Ability Power): A massive boost to your Helix Rocket damage, making them even more impactful for burst damage and ammo cycling.\nAlternative/Situational Items (Consider Swapping with Talon Module or Pulse Converter/Icy Coolant):\n\n- Salvaged Slugs (10% Attack Speed, 25% Increased Damage to Barriers. Dealing Weapon Damage to Barriers has a 40% chance to restore 1 ammo.): If the enemy has persistent barriers, this remains a strong option.\n\n- Liquid Nitrogen (25 Health, 10% Ability Power. Dealing ability damage slows the target\u2019s move speed by 20% for 3s.): If you need more crowd control, the slow effect on your Helix Rockets can be very valuable.\n\n- The Closer (20% Weapon Power, 10% Critical Damage. Critical Hits reveal the target for 3s.): If you are consistently landing critical hits and want even more damage potential, this is a good choice.\n\n- Codebreaker (15% Weapon Power, Ignore 50% of Armor\u2019s damage reduction.): Excellent against heavily armored tanks like Reinhardt, D.Va (in Mech), and Orisa. This will make your shots much more effective against their primary defenses.\n\n- Amari\u2019s Antidote (25 Health, 15% Weapon Power): A good all-around choice for increased survivability and a solid damage boost. Pick this if you need a bit more staying power.\n\n- Focus: Maintain a constant stream of fire with your Pulse Rifle to stack the Weapon Power from Power Chaingun. Use your powerful Helix Rockets frequently for burst damage, area denial, and to trigger ammo restoration from Commander's Clip and potentially Pulse Converter (if you kept it).
