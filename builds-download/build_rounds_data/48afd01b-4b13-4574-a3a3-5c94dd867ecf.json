It doesn't matter which one is first, as almost every orisa build tends to come online at round 3. Or at least all of mine do.\n\nIn low elo people just don't seem to understand that Spynstem is going to deflect and at higher elo it can be used to be a really oppressive projectile denial, as they'll understand how dangerous it is to let you deflect projectiles, due to how quickly Spynstem builds ult charge - the entire point of this build.\n\nIf you start with Spynstem update, however, Your enemies may call it out quickly and not let you get many deflects. If you wait for R3 to get spynstem, and start with centripetal, you can punish the fact that your opponents may be slower to call it out while your build is already online.\n\n# -----------------------------------\n\n# **Items**\n\n ## [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) \n\n ## [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) \n\n ## [Plasma Converter](item_25869f9a-9a29-4e19-96b6-9d8a28c59318) \n\nI almost always take Armored vest, Compensator, and plasma converter on every hero build, the extra bulk and weapon power are too strong to pass up, and on tanks I think lifesteal is a bit broken, especially in the early stages.\n\nIf you're playing on a longer mode, like Push, (or, I assume, payload race when it's introduced), you're much more likely to get your ult than if you're playing clash, so I would lose either compensator or plasma converter for Power Playbook, since AP is going to be the focus of this build, kind of.\n\nI also find that a lot of people don't seem to check builds in the scoreboard tab, so I wouldn't worry too hard about them calling it out at the start of round 3.",

The build was pretty much complete by round 4, and round 5 was pretty much just micro adjustments, so a lot of these items will be dealer's choice. I'll rank the items here, but know that they're pretty much interchangeable, and that you should use the ones you like.\n\n ## [3D-Printed Lance](item_b11e8cd7-9755-44bd-8857-f19457f6f1cf) : If you took Lassoed  over Factory reset, this item is pretty much a must. More javs = more cancer\n\n##  [Vanadium Injection](item_57953fbc-11ff-4e92-9928-fc59b7be668f) : Need I say more? It's an ult build, and this rewards us for having ult. Also works well with the lasso build, since you'll want to build jav spam, and this further decreases CD and increases AP\n\n##  [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) : Stops enemies from escaping your ult. It's a no brainer. Take this especially if they lack movement, or if they have too much movement, I guess. This will confirm kills with the former, and make you much more threatening to the latter.\n\n## [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) : AP, CDR, you know the drill. Take this if they have too much healing. Especially effective against junker queens for obvious reasons\n\n##  [Efi\u2019s Theorem](item_609c4cb6-a232-4e08-a11f-5252d40382be) : More bulk. Goated item in general. A little out of place on this build, but sometimes the enemy team just has that much CC\n\nyou need to sell at least one item to get your purple, obviously. I'd go with  [Multi-Tool](item_5ba8d94e-f2f3-44b7-8773-025fc6ed7c56), as its effectiveness just won't be scaling as well as Junker Watchamajig or crusader hydraulics.\n\nIf you have the cash for another purple, somehow, I'd sell  [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09)  next.",
