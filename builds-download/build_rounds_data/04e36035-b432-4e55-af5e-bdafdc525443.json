        "notes": "i always choose [Battle Medic] as my third round power, because it scales your valk damage massively. if you hit your shots, and aren't getting hard-focused, you can kill most squishies on your own, which turns the teamfight more often than some extra heals or a res (situational, obviously). i feel like [Renaissance] works better as a round five power, because you get more cd reduction (i.e. more res opportunities) and survival utility (i.e. you don't insta-die after your res) as the build ramps.\n\n[Battle Medic] does NOT scale your healing like i initially thought. after analysis on how i was actually using this (and still seeing better success than with the [Renaissance] power), it just came down to my gameplay. i was simply getting kills during ult. this meant more creds, which meant better items for healing. because you already have [Crepuscular Circle], you do NOT need to worry about healing your team in valk (assuming you stay in range ofc), it's literally automatic. so why not make yourself a bigger threat during it?\n\nhere's how i came to the conclusion that i prefer [Battle Medic]: if the game is going well for me (i.e. i'm playing well and escaping successfully when necessary, regardless of general team success), i typically get 2-3 valks and 1-2 revives per round in rounds 3 & 4. if you have similar stats, your options come down to: 1) will i be able to effectively be a terrifying flying machine gun of death during my ult, or 2) will i make effective use of 5-10 extra seconds (this is still significant!) of valk uptime per round.\n\ni totally recommend trying both out, and seeing what works for you! if i'm way surpassing my usual 1-2 revives, sometimes i'll take the [Renaissance] power first, then grab [Battle Medic] or [First Responder] in round 5. the powers are very flexible.\n\nif you've chosen [Battle Medic], here's my advice. it's tempting when you see those stacks go up, but don't pull out the blaster unless\n\nyou're chasing down a straggler after a teamfight or\nyou're in valk.\nyou lose the attack speed stacks if you swap between blaster and beam too much\n\nideally, you can get [Amari's Antidote], but if you're rolling in creds, you can get [Eye of the Spider], and if you're cred-poor, you can get [Codebreaker]\n\nif you don't have the creds for at least [Codebreaker] , you're likely getting rolled, but grab [Ironclad Exhaust Ports] for survival or [Advanced Nanobiotics] for heals depending on what your team needs\n\nbuy back [Compensator] , [Winning Attitude] , and/or [Weapon Grease] with any leftover creds",
