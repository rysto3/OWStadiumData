        "notes": "### \ud83d\udcb0 Starting Item Info:\n\nStarting items are pretty standard. You can swap [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da)  for  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6)  if needed.  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6)  is the superior option when you think you might be bursted down before you can safely reposition.  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0)  and  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)  together increase your HPS by about 6 which is quite a lot early. I often see Mercy\u2019s ignore these items in the first round and build only defensive items, which I would not recommend. Damage has not ramped up at this point and unless your team is being rolled, (which you wouldn\u2019t even know until after the fact) you should be able to live without them. \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Round Notes: \n\nThis round will be played fairly normally. Prioritize damage boost when you can, but do keep in mind that damage overall will be higher than normal Overwatch. You will need to be healing more often especially if your other support lacks healing or is just focusing on damage. Make it a habit to flick your beam to another ally at least every three seconds to always keep  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) active.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Tips & Advice:\n\n* **Always spend your cash.** You can sell for full price so please just spend all your cash every round.\n\n* **Know your maps.** Don't waste valk on clash maps when the point doesn't even open for another 10+ seconds. Don't waste valk or go for a risky rez to attempt to save a fight when you have the lead on push maps. Timing your ults and knowing when to start taking risks is very important and depends on your knowledge of map types and ability to pay attention. \n\n* **Don't hold valk.** This is not like normal overwatch, valk should not be saved only to keep yourself alive. Learn to valk aggressively and push damage boost to win fights or defensively even to heal your whole team. You will have valk almost every fight with how fast it builds with healing items, abuse this and valk often. \n\n* **Stay Alive.** This concept should not be new to you if you've played Mercy a long time. Mercy's value comes from staying alive. If you are dead, you are simply not useful at all to your team. Since you will not die often, you will often accumulate a decent sized bounty, don't abandon winnable fights to greed your bounty, but it is something to keep in mind.  \n\n* **Hit Tab.** I cannot emphasize this enough. Make it a habit to be checking your teammates and the enemy teams builds every round. This is just a good habit to develop and becomes even more so important when properly itemizing.",

[Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e)  is the most important item here and is the only item you will buy this round 100% of the time.  [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145)  can be dropped for more survivability. I would suggest in most scenarios prioritizing  [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016)  over  [Angeleisure Wear](item_00b53ed7-0768-442b-a2c3-8d19608c9391)  if it is your only defensive item.  [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145)  is also fairly situational as you might not be able to keep it active constantly, so it is something to keep in mind. \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Round Notes: \n\nThis is a really important round for farming Stadium Cash. If you made at least 10k cash, you will have a fairly large spike in your HPS and be able to make a ton of cash this round. Once again, damage boost when you can, but you will want to focus on healing more this round so you can get ahead on cash.",

        "notes": "### \ud83d\udcb0 Item Info:\n\nBuy [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) if you pick [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) here, if not prioritize more healing. I highly suggest doing so even if you think you won't need the extra survivability. Since this round is a big powerspike for many heroes and you might find yourself getting focused a lot more or in general taking significantly more damage. \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39Powers: \n\n  * [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) is great for simply buffing your healing. However it is a riskier pick because it can put you behind later as you won't have  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) until round 7 if the match even lasts that long.\n\n  * [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) is my personal favorite power because of how much survivability it gives you without sacrificing item slots and stats. This item synergizes ridiculously well with  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) for really strong early game survivability and is still very strong in the later rounds of the game. Pick this power when you are struggling to stay alive. \n\n  * [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) is simply just a really strong power. Healing builds give so much ult charge that you will usually have valk every fight and with how much weapon power you build, your healing will be very strong during valk. I typically refer to valk with this power as my \"auto win button\" for a reason. I will warn you though, if the matchup is riskier, typically because of double hitscan, it can be safer to not take this and simply abuse double beam length in valk. Just something to keep in mind.\n\n*There are other powers that are good in this build, but not worth it in my experience at round 3.* \n\n---\n\n### \u2795 Healing Info:\n\n\nMercy\u2019s healing is affected by both weapon power and attack speed. Weapon power directly increases the amount she heals and attack speed increases the rate at which Mercy heals. To optimize Mercy\u2019s HPS, you will want both weapon power and attack speed. This becomes less important later as there is a massive lack of epic attack speed items that work well with Mercy\u2019s kit. If your goal is simply to increase your healing, always prioritize rare items first, then add in epic items when you have the funds to start replacing them. I do not know how much cash you will make each round, so you will need to calculate what combination of items will increase your healing the most.\n\nOn top of this, epic items should be treated like a luxury. In terms of cost, they provide worse stats in return for valuable effects and taking up less item slots. For example with the standard 20k budget for this round buying only rare and common items we can get 105 HPS, whereas if we buy an epic item (I will use  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) for this example as it's one of the most cost effective epic items for healing) we can get 93 HPS (increased to 105 when healing an ally below 50%). Even when healing an ally below 50% life for  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) the rare items still heal the same amount and significantly more when above 50% life. In total the rare items cost 250 cash less too. This will be incredibly important to keep in mind in the following rounds, as I have no idea how much cash you will make each round and you will need to buy accordingly. \n\nKeep the three rare items  [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e)  [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145) and  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) as long as you can and replace  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) with epic items when you can afford it. If you cannot afford  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a), buy  [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) plus  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) and/or [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0). In fact if you have enough item slots, those three together are better than [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) and cheaper.  You might not have enough to buy an epic this round as you will need a lot of cash to replace [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) with  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) so continue to fill the gaps with rare items.",

        "notes": "### \ud83d\udcb0 Item Info:\n\n* I will describe pretty much every item I believe is viable in this build with one exception. As you may have noticed by now, I haven't mentioned any battle mercy items or powers despite them being fine in weapon power based builds as such. This is intentional to not bloat the build/guide and also because I honestly have a more passive playstyle and generally don't pull out the glock often. If you do like to battle mercy, it should be fairly simply to edit the build to your playstyle. \n\n  * [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) this is just a stat stick. It's an expensive item that offers a high amount of weapon power. Buy this if you are rich and need more healing. \n\n  * [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) gives decent attack speed. Movement speed is not very useful on Mercy, but it's a good item nonetheless.\n\n  * [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) can be bought if you need to abuse beam length to stay alive. \n\n  * [Volskaya Ordnance](item_396c0970-daa8-47e3-8049-e65f03fe5cec) gives decent attack speed. From my understanding this item also gives an increased 20% weapon power when healing an ally with at least 400 more life than you. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about that) So in theory this is great for healing tanks with large health pools and teams that generally built more health than you.\n\n  * [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) is another stat stick. Prioritize [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) but if you already have it, are ridiculously wealthy and don't need more survivability, it can be a good buy.\n\n  *  [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) - While this isn't a rez build, that doesn't mean you wont use rez ever.  Helps you get off some rezzes that would've typically been too risky otherwise. \n\n  * [Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) - If you need more survivability, buy this. Do not ever buy this item if you don't already have an item to help mitigate damage like armor or  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) as damage mitigation is more important. This item becomes significantly more important against burst heroes like [Juno](hero_035c63b7-084c-4abd-9de5-c9a00e9b6a18) and especially [Freja](hero_e80840a1-845d-4008-966c-585b7cb4a424). This is a must buy into  [Freja](hero_e80840a1-845d-4008-966c-585b7cb4a424) and will give you the much needed defensiveness to survive her insane burst damage. \n\n  * [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) is such a good item. It's cheap, gives you health, and gives you so much survivability. I really like this item paired with [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) as you can position yourself really far from your team and aren't punished for making too much distance with  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931). They can both be bought individually based on need, but they feel great together. \n\n  * [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) can be really good if your other support also built to heal. While this is a healing build, that doesn't mean you don't use damage boost ever. If my other support is healing a lot and/or I have good DPS or even a tank who could benefit from damage boost, I'll buy this. It also gives armor which helps a lot.",

I didn't mention powers that were mentioned in previous rounds to not bloat the build/guide too much, but they are all still good this round.\n\n  * [Distortion](item_5557e2f2-02df-4eac-8128-0c23b71183b1) contrary to popular belief, lifesteal affects both weapon damage AND ability damage. I don't pick this power when my teammates are squishy and die before they can utilize the lifesteal. Synergizes really well with  [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) too.\n\n  * [Protective Beam](item_3f1ef995-8ecc-45fb-8b57-26fdccc21feb) in my experience is really good with tankier teams and just further enhances their survivability. I tested this power a lot when trying to prevent my teammates from being one shot and can confidently say I don't recommend it with squishy teams. \n\n  * [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) synergizes very well with  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb).
