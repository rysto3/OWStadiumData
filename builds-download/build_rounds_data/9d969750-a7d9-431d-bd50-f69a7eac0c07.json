Combined with [Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61)'s ability to rip through them, it should provide you decent sustain. \n[Multi-Task Mod](item_40997c0f-a8e3-46ba-b312-34c0790d0e87) is another option, but you lose out on some survivability. \n\nIf you don't have enough, then add on some blues and/or greens instead of [Chip-Damage Diverter](item_d31f1c78-8c46-4411-a1f2-c0416efa9e9a). \n\nDue to D.Va's large armor pool, if you're struggling against enemies focused around WP/AS, you can take [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) for some flat damage resistance. \n[Solo Spec](item_a2c2f7c3-761d-42d2-a11c-28980f027c8f) is another survival item that is pretty good, especially at only 4k, but one I didn't find space for in this build. So, take it if you want. \n\n.\n\nVS REIN:\n[Chip-Damage Diverter](item_d31f1c78-8c46-4411-a1f2-c0416efa9e9a) also affects rein's shield, but would be not as effective without [Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) as well. If you have enough for [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27), [Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) and [Chip-Damage Diverter](item_d31f1c78-8c46-4411-a1f2-c0416efa9e9a), then go for it, but otherwise just pick whether you want to keep [Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) (more dps) or [Chip-Damage Diverter](item_d31f1c78-8c46-4411-a1f2-c0416efa9e9a) (more survivability). \n\nIf you can't afford two purples and [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) then just grab some blues and/or greens. (though not [Solo Spec](item_a2c2f7c3-761d-42d2-a11c-28980f027c8f), as that doesn't really help against rein)",

        "notes": "If you're picking the powers in the order suggested, then we finally get [Focused Fusion](item_1123c91f-7348-4e50-aa1c-4a9961650f40)! It's a very weird power, as it makes D.Va's playstyle very counter-intuitive to how she usually plays. Remember you don't want to be in people's faces, you're now a midrange tank. Try to stay at least 10m away from the enemies, to upwards of just over 20m. \nThis makes it so you're more able to take better angles to hide behind if you get poked out, as well as being able to save your boosters to get *away* from danger, rather than closing distance in order to do effective damage. \nIf you have tried and absolutely *despised* this power, then feel free to take [Stat Boost](item_d3ef725b-3183-417c-bc5a-76bfa21c6cc5) as an alternative. \n\n\n[Multi-Task Mod](item_40997c0f-a8e3-46ba-b312-34c0790d0e87) lets you shoot while using DM, something that helps you even against zarya when combined with [Plot Armor](item_d1427316-79d1-43a7-a608-67beb1595131) and [FaceTanking](item_f8af63d1-1fd4-4758-86ce-96f1ef7ea1ea). \n\nIf you think you'll run out of DM too quickly, or that's too many buttons for your brain, (boosters in while shooting, using DM and missiles is definitely a lot at once, haha), then there's a few alternative options: \n- [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) is especially effective against beam weapons and if you're struggling taking too much damage from Zarya still, it'd be good to slot that in, even potentially in place of something else more DPS-focused in later rounds. \n- [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) is mostly a good dps-heavy item, but also can give you a bit of a movement speed boost. \n- [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) gives you a boost to WP and AP, but also gives you more opportunity for sustain in the form of its lifesteal. There's also the overhealth, which is nice, but as a tank you're probably not going to see the benefit of all that often.\n\n.\n\nVS REIN: \nBit of the same for powers from this one, more survivability centred around your DM isn't bad due to adding sustain against the rest of his team, though if you really didn't care for that you could go [Express Detonation](item_8da4cbad-78cb-4ebd-8bc4-8dc150afec95) for the surprise factor or [Overstocked](item_d6b946fd-0fd8-4ba1-85d0-601995136eb6) for a little bit of free damage, especially if you take [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643). \n\n[Multi-Task Mod](item_40997c0f-a8e3-46ba-b312-34c0790d0e87) doesn't do much for you again rein, but with likely enough cash for three purples, then you should be able to get finally get [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27), [Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) and [Chip-Damage Diverter](item_d31f1c78-8c46-4411-a1f2-c0416efa9e9a). \nIf you don't want to grab all of those however, [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) or [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) are both good against a rein.",

The items are: \n- [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d): as said before, this is especially good against beam weapons like zarya, so if you want survivability this is the go-to. \n- [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b): just a very good item, adds a lot of DPS and ability to finish off kills. It is expensive though. \n- [El-sa'ka Supressor](item_b4298dd9-9b93-461f-a2e0-843402667100): it doesn't have as much raw DPS output than any of the other options that aren't focused on survivability, but in turn it gives enemies an anti-heal debuff whenever a single one of the pellets of your guns hits a headshot. This effect can be cleansed by zarya bubbles, but you should be shredding through those, and you're forcing her to use them just to cleanse the effect. \n\n.\n\nVS REIN: \nFor powers, it's pretty much the same thing as listed above for zarya. \n\nSame as last round, your build will look pretty much the same save for [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) over [Multi-Task Mod](item_40997c0f-a8e3-46ba-b312-34c0790d0e87) and [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) or [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) instead of [Plot Armor](item_d1427316-79d1-43a7-a608-67beb1595131).\n\nAlso similarly to the zarya version of the build, it's your choice if you want to replace [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) (mix dps and survivability through sustain) or [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) (dps and small movement speed buff) with:\n- [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b): high dps output and ability to finish low-health targets.\n- [El-sa'ka Supressor](item_b4298dd9-9b93-461f-a2e0-843402667100): less pure dps than other options, but in exchange applies anti-heal debuff to anyone hit in the head with a pellet from your gun. \n\nUnlike the zarya version of the build, if you happen to have way more cash, you could also swap out the final blue item for another purple, since you aren't required to keep [Plot Armor](item_d1427316-79d1-43a7-a608-67beb1595131).",
