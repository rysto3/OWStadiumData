        "notes": "[Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) is easily one of Mercy's top powers, as the utility it offers in terms of damage output and healing output is increased immensely. If you're not taking this power, you're likely starting off wrong.\n\nAs it's Round 1, item selection is rather negligible. Take [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) and [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) for a slight boost to your healing output, and [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) for a solid survivability tool. The extra shields and regeneration time can help keep you up longer in battle.\n\nKeep in mind that you are __NOT__ a pocket support. Your primary goal is to keep your team up. Play Mercy like you would normally, positioning behind cover. When your team is not taking mass amount of damage, push damage boost by swapping beam between your two DPS or Tank/Other Support if they are using strong, key abilities. Lock your beam onto whoever needs healing as necessary. Avoid risky resurrections unless you are __CONFIDENT__ you can pull them off.\n\nTry not to save Valkyrie, it is a less than game-changing ultimate in the early rounds, and saving it doesn't fit well with the fast pace of Stadium.",

Ideally, you should be able to have this up every other team fight (or two, maybe), as Mercy builds ultimate incredibly fast in this mode.\n\nYour attack speed from [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) will come in handy here, as you will have no other choice but to DPS during your ultimate. Mercy can quickly unload a barrage of bullets into the enemy team, which can help secure eliminations. __Do not__ get overzealous and extend too far, as a Cassidy or Soldier 76 can shut down Mercy very quickly. Also keep an eye out for low health teammates, and proc [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) as necessary.\n\nDump all your remaining cash onto blue / green items that boost Weapon Power and Attack Speed.

The Weapon Power and Attack Speed you have already, plus the bonus from the power itself essentially allows Mercy to machine gun down the enemy team during her ultimate.\n\nIf you'd rather fully invest in healing, then take [Glass Extra Full](item_659ff350-8602-42cd-b5f9-f4da7e5e912b) for the added overhealth that can be procced by either [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) or Valkyrie.\n\nAim to invest in [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) if you have the cash for it, and whichever you __DIDN'T__ take between [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) and [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) if you don't already have them both.\n\nIf you do not have enough cash, invest in the same blue/green recommended options that you have been throughout the run so far over the options above.",
