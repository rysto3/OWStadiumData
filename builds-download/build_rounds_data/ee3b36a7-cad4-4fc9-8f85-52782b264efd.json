        "notes": "For Round 1, I'll lead off with either Reverb or Let's Bounce.\n\nBecause of Let's Bounce getting nerfed recently, I'll usually lean towards Reverb (the former can still work depending on the map) - not having the extra knockback or wallbang is made up for by simply having a second boop.\n\nEspecially if the enemy team doesn't have too much autoaim to kill you with, look to be aggressive and force enemies out of position with the double boop (denying them high grounds or sending them into your team with no way out are some of the ability's best use cases). In other scenarios, the double boop can still be useful to peel enemies off your DPS or other support, win duels, etc.\n\nFor starting items, Power Playbook is a given (1000 credits for 10 AP is a no-brainer) and then Armored Vest or First-Aid Kit are both useful to not die to air upon entering the fight (I prefer the former). The third starting item is relatively open depending on your playstyle.\n\nMore aggressive playstyles benefit from extra damage/attack speed, whereas if you spend your whole game healbotting, Charged Plating is pretty good wherever rounds can last a while.",

If cash is really tight, drop Armored Vest and play less aggressive. After all, ability power is what makes this build work.\n\nCustom Stock is the item I default to 99% of the time - it is a cheap item that gives decent stats for its cost, especially at this point in the game.\n\nThe other rare AP item you'll get is more playstyle dependent. Energized Bracers are good for taking aggressive duels (and they'll get even better with Let's Bounce), \nMulti-Tool is better for sitting with your team and peeling for them (a 5% reduction to a 4-second cooldown isn't going to mean much when dueling anyway, versus reducing it from your 12-second amp cooldown), \nand #1 Single is good for a hybrid of these playstyles - where you balance between off-angling with one of your DPS and helping your core, as both parts of your team will have much more uptime on your healing/speed with the lingering effect.\n\nI'll pick:\n#1 Single if I'm queueing with friends (macro knowledge l0l),\nor Energized Bracers/Multi-Tool depending on how much cash I end up getting from round 1.\n\nLo-Fly Beats is terrible and it makes me want to vomit.\nNano Boop is just too niche to really be useful.\nNano Cola at this point assumes you made a lot of money from Round 1 - if by some crazy off chance you did, replace your second rare AP item (not Custom Stock) with it.",

Fusion Drive's armor combined with Energized Bracers' ability lifesteal combined with how many boops you get gives you a significant amount of survivability.\n\nIf you feel like not feeding your brains out, Catalytic Crystal is a solid option - extra AP combined with the fact that all of Lucio's healing is ability based gives you Beat quite fast.",

After all, all your healing is ability based, and so is a solid chunk of your damage (Let's Bounce's wallbang damage scales with AP as well as your standard boop damage), giving you much better ult charge.\nAnyways, get this item.\nBy now, you most likely have enough money to replace Power Playbook with another rare AP item. If you do, feel free to - otherwise, don't worry too much about it.",
