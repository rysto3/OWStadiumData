Round 1 .......................................\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1 Powers:\n\n- Since [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) was nerfed to the ground, we won't benefit as much from having 2 torpedo charges, thus we'll just skip [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212) completely that we used to take and instead go directly into [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90). This will allow us to be online at round 2. Staying alive and getting to places faster means more time and more opportunities to get cash!\n\n---\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items:\n\n- Since we have [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90) we can access the health packs quicker and more often. So we buy [Adrenaline Shot](item_ab8eba6a-0bda-4b12-8854-4ba4169b515f) since it's the best defensive item for $1500 for our build's speed specifically.\n\n- Since we are spamming left click to heal our allies, we'll take [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) in an attempt to squeeze in a bit more healing per second to earn more cash.\n\n- And [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) to increase our healing numbers.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Keep left-clicking your tank. Its literally free cash. And tanks are the strongest characters on the lobby at Round 1.\n\n- If you have to go for a kill, remember that your Quick-melees deal more damage than your pistol!\n\n- Play safe this first round, you don't have [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) yet so you can't go dummy on the offensive. Farm some cash and chill while the enemy can't catch you!\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- If you don't know where the health packs for the current map you can take [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) instead of [Adrenaline Shot](item_ab8eba6a-0bda-4b12-8854-4ba4169b515f).",

Round 2 ......................................\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items:\n\n- You wanna get [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) no matter what, since it synergizes with [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90). Buy it, admire it, adore it, cause from now on you are [TITLE-CARD].\n\n- The rest of the item slots will be filled with Survival Commons that give you 25 hp each. You can literally buy every single one of them. Raw %AP doesn't make sense anymore if we don't take Pulsar Plus 1st round, and %WP isn't needed at this stage of the game, you heal enough already, what's going to affect the outcome of the round the most are survival items (specifically here at Round 2).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Your primary objective isn't winning, but to farm money. Now that you have [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) you should be more aggressive with your dashes.\n\n- You still want to focus on healing your allies this round since you don't have enough damage to kill people yet and thus need to farm money the old fashioned way.\n\n- ### \u25b6\ufe0f Season 17 - Round 2 - Gameplay Showcase:\n[YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/embed/mguCpFyDId8)\n\n- If you are tryhard enough you want to, at the start of the round, quickly run and flank the enemy team so they look at you for some time. This will ensure your team has a better starting position on the objective, you should be doing this from now on every round. After a little while you can come back to your team (on this round specifically you wont be able to kill anybody but you can TAUNT them!).\n\n- ### This is the perfect example of it (All-Stars 1 - Round 2):\n[Round 2 - Start example:](https://youtube.com/embed/PCarF0YsCK0 \"medium\")\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- If you are fat rich, you can swap [Winning Attitude](item_8714087c-c078-4619-a2ef-327bc6edaa69) for [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09). This item works as long as you have armor, and the 25 Armor it gives you hides behind your vast pool of shields and overhealth, so you will have 10% reduction to weapons most often! It's a great item for this build in particular.",

Round 3 ......................................\n\n### \u26a1 Powers:  \n\n- We now take [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca). It got buffed recently from 50 to 100 Overhealth. Since you are gonna start build damage with your items from now on this will ensure you can maintain your hyper agressive playstyle against good players. (Maybe in lower MMR lobbies you can get away with [Stinger](item_e9d0d530-d620-4e74-a34d-38cdebfeb9a4) but against people who seem like they have aimbot [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) wins you the matchup).\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 Tips:\n- [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca): If you use your E,  wait for the speed buff to go away, and then go through the ring to get the speedboost again, you'll also gain the overhealth again! This is what makes this Power so broken! Also, try to aim your E where allies can use it or where you'd want to go next.\n![Hyper Healer double buff](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExc2Q5aWpwOTZkdDNrNGoxdXF0eXYyY3Y1MGdjN2xpcW4yM25hbmlreCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/YbD7ZNXFvyGlggT2Fv/giphy.gif)\n\n- Try to aim your E towards your team whenever possible. And communicate what your [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) does so they can play around it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- We take [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) to pair with [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90). From now on, every time you use an ability, the next time you *hit* an enemy with your primary fire it will deal 25*AP extra damage! (if you miss, the *charge* isn't consumed, so don't worry). This is your primary source of damage and the way you'll kill/heal people now.\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 Tips:\n- [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) only needs 1 bullet to hit the enemy. Your left-clicks shoot multiple. So you should be flicking your crossair around to ensure you hit at least 1 bullet on your target! Dont just aim at them, \"swing\" your crossair around your target so you can ensure at least 1 hit!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Your style of play from now on should be like an assassin, **you are a DPS** that just so happens to have some healing capabilities as well. Your job is to \"taunt\" the enemies into surrendering advantageous positions so your team can comfortably win point. \n\n- Gain confidence, and flank! If you die you learn, but keep being aggressive since its **YOUR** responsability to carry the game, not your team's.\n\n- ### \u25b6\ufe0f Season 17 - Round 3 - Gameplay Showcase:\n(This is from the same match as the Round 2 Gameplay Showcase)\n[YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/embed/hWXPv65vTqk)\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals: \n\nBased on your budget:\n\n- You always keep [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) and [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0).\n\n- $19k ~ $21.5k: Get [Adrenaline Shot](item_ab8eba6a-0bda-4b12-8854-4ba4169b515f) and then if you still have money get [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da). (Why not [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6)? Because since we have so many shields already, the passive regeneration effect becomes much more valuable).\n\n- $22k: Get [Adrenaline Shot](item_ab8eba6a-0bda-4b12-8854-4ba4169b515f) + [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09).

Round 4 ......................................\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- Just like last round, we will now buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429), which works the same way as [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) does. Dealing ~27 extra damage against 300 HP enemies after every ability. This is thanks to our primary weapon being a burst of many little bullets, triggering the %hp damage 3 times in a single left-click!\n\n- If you lack cash to buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) you can sell anything that's not [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) or [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) for it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Same as previous round. But harder emphasis on hitting at *least* 3 shots of your gun in-between abilities.\n\n- Keep playing on enemy backlines, remember that healing gives you good cash as well, and remember to re-hydrate with health packs!\n\n- ### \u25b6\ufe0f Season 17 - Round 4 - Gameplay Showcase:\n[YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/embed/gj3884Y2gpQ)\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\nIf you have extra cash:\n\n- If the enemy has an [Ana](hero_f1aee6cf-704f-455f-a100-ec882ebbe000) with [Tranquilizer](item_2bea20a0-21c0-4a52-b81e-596c17d184b4) and an [Ashe](hero_37b42a2d-a82d-4a22-9df2-4c812c873b54) going for an %AP build, i highly recommend buying [Cushioned Padding](item_20f2f4bc-4611-4d1f-b653-20f04d56b96f) if you have extra money. In fact, tell your tank to buy it as well. One of the few things that can kill you easily is Ana's sleep dart and [Cushioned Padding](item_20f2f4bc-4611-4d1f-b653-20f04d56b96f) solves that issue.\n\n- Otherwise get [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09).\n\n- If you don't have enough money get [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) and some survival items.",

If not more aggressive now.

Round 6 ......................................\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) will complete your defensive package giving you now regeneration, which is something we didn't have till now. It builds %AP as well so we don't lose on building damage, it's a 3 in 1 item, damage + armor + regeneration. Really good! (You get 25 HP/s constantly with it).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Go nuts, you shouldn't be able to die if you play semi-decently. Use your fast mobility and your tankiness to attract attention. If you can mess with their DPS or Supports, while they are bothered shooting at you, they arent shooting at your team, or healing their tank, if you can kill them then the better but even just shifting their attention to you is valuable to help your team. If they don't respond you, kill them, if they do, you waste their time, its a win-win situation for you! Stay alive and go for the most important player!\n\n- ### \u25b6\ufe0f Season 17 - Round 6 - Gameplay Showcase:\n[YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/embed/hdJksAO073M)\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- You can get [Gravitational Push](item_2df314f2-c983-4984-bb08-070f93add5e1) instead of [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8). This item gives us 35% worth of stats + disruption. We can push twice during a blink boost glide. You can literally kidnap the enemy tank with this or get them off the point! It's insanely good to taunt players and on the hands of a good player you can move your enemies where you can aislate them from their supports to kill them much easier!\n![Image](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZGhud2UwZWF6a2kwd2VvaWpweHpwdHpjMW5tYmI2dHpqaWJ6cDY2ZyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/G3Fm191himwSvTG5Aw/giphy.gif)\n\nIf you have extra cash, instead of [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) you can:\n\n- If the enemy has an [Ana](hero_f1aee6cf-704f-455f-a100-ec882ebbe000) with [Tranquilizer](item_2bea20a0-21c0-4a52-b81e-596c17d184b4) and an [Ashe](hero_37b42a2d-a82d-4a22-9df2-4c812c873b54) going for an %AP build, i highly recommend buying [Cushioned Padding](item_20f2f4bc-4611-4d1f-b653-20f04d56b96f) if you have extra money. In fact, tell your tank to buy it as well. One of the few things that can kill you easily is Ana's sleep dart and [Cushioned Padding](item_20f2f4bc-4611-4d1f-b653-20f04d56b96f) solves that issue.\n\n- Otherwise get [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09).\n\n- If you don't have enough money for [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) get a [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) instead.",

Round 7 ......................................\n\n### \u26a1 Powers:  \n\n- Without a doubt the best power we can take rn is [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212). It's incredibly good, so much that we used to take it on Round 1 in this build on season 16! It will increase your healing/damage and give you more procs for your items!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- We need to keep [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) and [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) so we stay relevant in fights.\n\n- We need to keep [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) and [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) for defensive matters.\n\n- We need to keep [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) so our team is actually able to kill stuff this late into the game.\n\n- And so we are left with 1 space that might as well be raw %AP, so we buy [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) as our last item.\n\n- ### \u25b6\ufe0f Season 17 - Round 7 - Gameplay Showcase:\n[YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/embed/XwiobRyWYg8)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- The gameplan is simple, stay with your team and play together. Enemy builds reached a point where you can't keep playing like you used to, so stay back and relax, if you lose this round it's not entirely your fault, you no longer have high agency on the game and depend on your team to do decently to win. Do your job as a support, and see what happens next. (Still, try to go for kills, don't completely change to a passive playstyle, what i mean is that you should keep playing for kills as a DPS Juno but look out for your team not to die in the meantime).\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- If you like you can go for an infinite flight style with [Boosted Rockets](item_c3e0738f-cce2-431a-ad52-39176df84923). You'd sell [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) for it and try to stay high up in the sky raining rockets from above.\n\n---\n\nAnyways! Hope the build helped! The new heros are a TON of fun and im so happy Juno stays relevant in the META! :3",
