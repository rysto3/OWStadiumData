        "notes": "##  ........................................ Round 1 ........................................\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1 Powers:\n\n- The most influential powers early game are usually \"actives\". This is the case for Juno as we take  [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212) .\n\n- Why not take [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90) first round?\nBecause it's only good when paired with  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) and you'd only be able to buy it at round 2 at the earliest. You need to prioritize getting cash on these first 2 rounds and the power that gives you the most cash is  [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212). It increases your damage AND healing output. No matter what you shoot, it will give you money to spend on the later rounds.\n\n---\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items:\n\n- The most influential items on 1st round for low HP characters are Survival, though, not using 100% of our cash isnt beneficial so we'll only take 1. [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) being our best option for its passive.\n\n- Then, to increase our Torpedo damage we buy [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418).\n- And since we are spamming left click to heal our allies, we'll take  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) in an attempt to squeeze in a bit more healing numbers to earn more cash.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Keep left-clicking your tank. Its literally free cash. And tanks are the strongest characters on the lobby at Round 1.\n\n- When you see an opening, try to jump high and to a side angle where enemies cant see you coming, and then torpedo twice. Your torpedos are best used when in pairs because you are not just trying to get healing or damage numbers, you want kills, and most importantly, assists!\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- If its a good map for [Adrenaline Shot](item_ab8eba6a-0bda-4b12-8854-4ba4169b515f) then use that instead of [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da).",

        "notes": "##  ........................................ Round 2 ........................................\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items:\n\n- To get the most out of our money, we'll buy [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a), which gives us 20% WP for only 4k (its the best ratio you can find for WP, at 200$ per every 1% WP).\n\n- Then we'll take a key item to the build:  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) . This item will be your best and only defensive item from Round 3 onwards.\n\n- You can change [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) for either [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) or [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) to focus more on your torpedos instead. Although if you have good aim, i highly recommend you follow the recommended items since they will give you the most cash.\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 Tips:\n- Thanks to  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689), right-clicks from now on will give you 88 Overhealth as long as you are aiming your torpedos. **Once you shoot, the Overhealth dissapears**, so if you are trying to escape, hold the torpedos!\n- Try to stay on the air while you shoot enemies to fully take advantage of  [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a)!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Your primary objective isn't winning, but to farm money. Now that you have [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) you should be more aggressive with your torpedos since you have more damage AND survivability with them.\n\n- If you got [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) you'll swap from left-clicking your tank, to left-clicking the enemy tank (of course, without forgetting about healing your tank from time to time). And you'll do this while jumping and gliding to get the effect from  [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) going.\n\n- If you got [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) you'll keep left-clicking your tank, and focus more on getting your torpedos to hit stuff.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- If you are fat rich, i suggest you buy defensive items. The longer you stay alive the more cash you'll earn and the more cash you will deny enemies from having.  \n\n- [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) is insane on Juno since the 25 Armor it gives you will hide behind your ~150 shields giving you 10% damage reduction for more than half you life total! Especially good against  [Super Visor](item_b3db0ab0-26b4-4d99-893d-175f6726c9e9) [Soldier: 76](hero_e1ac7ef5-4648-4998-b8b0-9e3da3e60546), [Incendiary Rounds](item_0cff5b79-dd12-475a-aca1-24fd4e8b8491) [Ashe](hero_37b42a2d-a82d-4a22-9df2-4c812c873b54) and  [Full House](item_0001a9dc-79d5-48c9-92b0-85060efd897e) or  [Quick Draw](item_fce335e5-8093-4936-98c1-12ee26efd5d3) [Cassidy](hero_3dd63854-7558-4344-86e4-b506f807129b).\n\n- Otherwise, you can take  [Reinforced Titanium](item_8ebaa7db-aedf-48ed-adc1-318cb46a3214), which should counter any Ability Power builds like  [Double Helix](item_808afc07-1398-4962-bf2c-f8e3b74014e3) [Soldier: 76](hero_e1ac7ef5-4648-4998-b8b0-9e3da3e60546) or [Pulsar Plus](item_4795ae1f-580d-47ec-a01d-0933cba56212) [Juno](hero_035c63b7-084c-4abd-9de5-c9a00e9b6a18) for example.",

This is non-negotiable.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n*\"Usually its better to fill your Item slots with rares since they have the best stats for the dollar ratio. But thanks to our powers we have 6 ability casts on short cooldowns that we can use to abuse [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb), and that just happens to be BROKEN!!!\"*\n\n- We take [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) to pair with [Blink Boosts](item_9bac3119-781b-4dc0-94fa-9c293c02dc90). This is non-negotiable.\n\n- Since we have so many ability casts, [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) becomes BROKEN on Juno! You literally become... [TITLE CARD].\n\n- [Vantage Shot](item_6d7a0598-07cf-45ea-bbf5-c7e7b975e07a) is no longer needed as our healing and damage will be based off of AP ratios now. So we sell it to afford [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0).\n\n- If you have extra money, buy [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) and then [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6). \n\n- If you are fat rich get yourself a [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429). You can sell  [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) for it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Your style of play from now on should be like an assassin, **you are a DPS** that just so happens to have some healing capabilities as well. You will spam your glides while dueling so they can give you 25 Overhealth each time and 32.5 extra damage on your next shot. Fly around like a wasp stinging everyone and anyone thats not the tank! Gain confidence, if you die you learn, but keep being aggressive since its **YOUR** responsability to carry the game, not your team's.\n\n- From now on, every time you use an ability, the next time you *hit* an enemy with your primary fire it will deal (25*1.3) 32.5 extra damage! (if you miss, the *charge* isn't consumed, so don't worry)\n\n- The charge doesn't expire with time, so you can stack one charge of [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) while out of combat.\n\n- You can now kill enemies with this combo: (Shoot \u27a1\ufe0f Glide \u27a1\ufe0f  Shoot \u27a1\ufe0f Torpedo \u27a1\ufe0f Shoot). *If they are being healed, you'll of course need to either use more Glides or more Torpedos.*\n\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals: \n\n- There's a REALLY fun item you can take called [Boosted Rockets](item_c3e0738f-cce2-431a-ad52-39176df84923). It will make your Glide Boosts INFINITE! Yes, i said INFINITE. This item dooooooes stall time from which you could activate another glide boost, basically reducing your Damage Per Second for  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) triggers, but it allows you to stay in the air indefinetly, so i guess its based on playstyle?

        "notes": "##  ........................................ Round 4 ........................................\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- Just like last round, we will now buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429), which works the same way as [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) does. Dealing ~27 extra damage against 300 HP enemies after every ability. This is thanks to our primary weapon being a burst of many little bullets, triggering the %hp damage 3 times in a single left-click!\n\n- Extra cash can and should go towards our survivability. As explained in \"Round 2 / Optionals\" you can either take [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) or [Reinforced Titanium](item_8ebaa7db-aedf-48ed-adc1-318cb46a3214).\n\n- If you lack cash to buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) you can sell [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) for it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Same as previous round. But harder emphasis on hitting at *least* 3 shots of your gun in-between abilities.\n\n- This charge doesn't expire with time, so you can also stack one charge of [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) while out of combat.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- There's an argument for [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) here at Round 4. If you analyze that your biggest obstacle to win the round is an insane ammount of heals comming from the enemy team, A.K.A. when you are against two main healers such as [Mercy](hero_0e213bfc-3ca9-49c6-9036-e7f344b752da) + [Moira](hero_7fb6ff1e-a193-40c0-bd0a-25c1928fbaed) for example, then this isnt such a bad idea to take now. This doesnt mean every time they run 2 main healers you go  [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505), its just an option you have that you'll do maybe 5~10% of the time and only when you have a competent team and are not against a [D.Va](hero_e8e1dc68-45c4-47c2-b421-95e33594e6b6).",

Round 5 ........................................\n\n### \u26a1 Powers:  \n\n*\"After a week of testings, from the three options i was suggesting,  [Medimaster](item_a04e1041-01c1-46ed-801e-d0590003e9b6),  [Stinger](item_e9d0d530-d620-4e74-a34d-38cdebfeb9a4) or  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca), the latter proved to be the most effective in high MMR lobbies.\"*\n\n- We'll be taking [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) because it enhances what we've been building towards, an immortal deadly fly that annoys and destroys enemy backlines. This power proved capable of beating a good aim  [Cassidy](hero_3dd63854-7558-4344-86e4-b506f807129b) and [Soldier: 76](hero_e1ac7ef5-4648-4998-b8b0-9e3da3e60546) while [Medimaster](item_a04e1041-01c1-46ed-801e-d0590003e9b6) and [Stinger](item_e9d0d530-d620-4e74-a34d-38cdebfeb9a4) often had problems dealing with them.\n\n- It's rare, but very few times  [Medicinal Missiles](item_30eeab6c-4a1e-4a16-b9dd-e83d633caa40) can be the better choice if you have a  [Restortify](item_e5073fbb-8287-4d11-934a-1fc1c57a308b)  [Orisa](hero_91644d44-1093-4f62-ac51-020975465e85) in your team and you don't think you'll need  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca). This will force you to play more passively, which is not what we are trying to do at all haha, only do this when you have a team that can carry you.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n-  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) has proved to do  [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643)'s job but better. It gives us 50 Armor and 25 hp/s while still upgrading our damage. Very good item that enhances our playstyle of being an annoying immortal fly of death.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Keep it going like you were before. If not more aggressive now. The longer fights go on for the better for you since you have so much stall tools. If you get  [Boosted Rockets](item_c3e0738f-cce2-431a-ad52-39176df84923) you can stall forever.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n- If you dont have much cash you can buy [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) and either [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) or [Reinforced Titanium](item_8ebaa7db-aedf-48ed-adc1-318cb46a3214) instead of an epic.\n\n- If you identify that the enemy healers are the reason you aren't killing so much, try [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) instead.",

Round 6 ........................................\n\n*\"By Round 6 there's a lot of Optionals you could've taken, so to simplify i'll assume you took no Optionals and instead, followed the main path of the build.\"*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- By this point, the enemy team has so much healing its hard to one-shot people with your fast combos, so we need  [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) to mitigate this problem. Having/not having this item is most often than not the difference between winning and losing teamfights this late in the game.\n\n- If somehow you have enough money to buy [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) then do that instead or if you can sell [Lock-On Shield](item_220287f8-1dc5-4a6c-9e86-c14cf970b689) for it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- Go nuts, you shouldn't be able to die if you play semi-decently. Use your fast movility and your tankiness to attract attention. If you can mess with their DPS or Supports, while they are bothered shooting at you, they arent shooting at your team, or healing their tank, if you can kill them then the better but even just shifting their attention to you is valuable to help your team. If they dont respond you kill them, if they do you waste their time, its a win-win situation for you! Stay alive and go for the most important player!\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optionals:\n\n-  [Solar Shielding](item_804fd8cd-78bd-46ee-a89f-20a6c9cccdcc) is a better alternative ONLY if your team all have shields, or at least 4 people have shields. Its better, but only on that scenario.\n\n-  And as always, [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) if you can afford it instead.\n\n---\n\n####  ..................................................*\"This is the peak of the build.\"*...................................................",

Round 7 ........................................\n\n- UPDATE:  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) was buffed to give double the Overhealth so its more beneficial to build raw %AP now, which means we can take many %AP items and pair it with an %AP Power such as  [Medicinal Missiles](item_30eeab6c-4a1e-4a16-b9dd-e83d633caa40) to get good results.\n\n\n---\n\n### \u26a1 Powers:  \n\n- The plan is simple, put everything into %AP to make our torpedos and  [Hyper Healer](item_108336b3-54d2-4d69-8ea4-c2da5affb7ca) better. So on top of that we'll add  [Medicinal Missiles](item_30eeab6c-4a1e-4a16-b9dd-e83d633caa40) since they'll recieve support from that much %AP.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca3 Items: \n\n- Pretty easy, get the items that give you the most %AP and Cooldown Reduction.  [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) and  [Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e) are perfect for this.\n\n- We need to keep [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) and  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) so we stay relevant in fights.\n\n- We'll get [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) to make the enemy team actually killable.\n\n- And finally, we keep  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) for defensive matters.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfae Playstyle:\n\n- The gameplan is simple, stay back and heal your team, focus the enemy tank. You lost all your good defensive items so now you are more squishy than ever. Stay back and play as a real support this time.\n\n---\n\nAnyways! Hope the build helped! Its been a ton of fun to grind her on Stadium! (^u^) Peace! \u2665\ufe0f",
