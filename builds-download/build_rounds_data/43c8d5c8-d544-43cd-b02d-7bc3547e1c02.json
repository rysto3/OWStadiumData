        "notes": "Optimal Overflow was the best recommendation my game partner ever gave me for this build; This power means that you can heal halfway and then dip, as it produces a healing orb to finish the job for you and you can move on to another teammate or target.\n\nAs for our abilities, Subatomic Splitter means that your prey can\u2019t escape you. Moira\u2019s range is already generous, but with this perk there is no escaping your grasp.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t sell any previous abilities just to afford Subatomic Splitter, but as this is a relatively cheap build you should be able to buy at least one Epic this round.",
