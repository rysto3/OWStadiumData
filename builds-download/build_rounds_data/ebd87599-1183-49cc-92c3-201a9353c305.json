You definitely want Smashing now, and if you're confident enough if your charging and ability to disengage afterwards if you messed up or get outplayed, this is a good time to pick  [Gryphon Glider](item_9dbd1ba2-b555-450a-8a62-5e33b45c8df6)\n\nWhile [Smashing!](item_a7021e28-cb8a-4f39-aeb1-380525b3fea9) will give you lifesteal, you can take/keep another lifesteal item if you have the money.\n\nWith these flying charges, you can do some pretty quick mid-fight charges to reposition, but it's very flashy. And, you don't need  [Cushioned Padding](item_20f2f4bc-4611-4d1f-b653-20f04d56b96f) in a Reinhardt mirror as much now, since you can just go over him.\n\nTo get the most fun out of this ability, you can also fully commit and go long, just be aware that most support characters and players will not be able to keep up because you can fly over or through most of most maps with this ability.\n\nI like to double up on purple and take  [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) and attack speed item with it.\n\nIf you'd rather [Gryphon Glider](item_9dbd1ba2-b555-450a-8a62-5e33b45c8df6) come online later than now, you can take [Gloomgauntlet](item_76cb8fe3-3c1f-4769-a1ec-a9c2dc510ba7) and [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48), that will be quite good.\n\nI have also put in some optional blue items incase you haven't gotten enough money for two purples, or if two purples and a blue doesn't cover enough stat ground.

I will still try and provide options for those who did not perform well, and I'll put the pricier ones in the optional section, but they will be the better picks if you can afford them.\n\nAt this point, for the most crazy fun, you want to be able to get in, maybe ruin a few peoples day and take some good space for your team, and get out alive.\n\nSmarter play would just use flying charge for repositioning, getting out of an engage, and/or pinning people who would usually be out of your reach, like some flying characters or those on high ground.",
