        "notes": "The idea behind Mark of the Kitsune is that you can use Biotic Field or Helix Rockets early, before a fight, and get bonus damage to your next bullet hit on an enemy. This bonus will not expire over time if you do not shoot anyone and it scales with ability power. \n\nSo in the first 2-3 shots you can deal damage like in 5-6 hits. Right after the first shots you fire Helix, and the bonus from Mark of the Kitsune activates again for the next hit if you need to finish off a target. That's why you don't need weapon damage or attack speed, just ability power.\n\nThis item, as well as the second power for Helix Rockets, create a turning point: now your build is online and you don't need survival or weapon damage. You should only look for an opportunity for an off-angle and combo, and run to safety immediately after you finish it. You can play as a flanker, or you can spam combos on the main while behind the tank: it all depends on how comfortable you are finding your opportunities and what map it is.",

        "notes": "In round 5, all meta builds will get another big power spike. Usually, you just want to get the most ability power for your money, but sometimes it makes sense to think about survival. Judge based on the HP of your opponents: if they go for damage and neglect survival, then you can do the opposite, because you will definitely have enough damage to kill them faster. And vice versa.\n\nBesides the obvious items that give armor or shields, I would highlight Iron Lung, because it fits your playstyle perfectly and works not only as an overhealth, but also as a continuous heal while you are sprinting, which is very helpful for survival. You can assume that your maximum HP will not just be +25%, but +35% or even more if someone is chasing you.\n\nAs for the choice of the third Power, everything is obvious: to increase your survivability, as well as to always have the ability to press the combo \"Biotic Field - shot - Helix - shot\", you take Track and Field",

Firstly, on some maps it will help you both to occupy the high ground (which makes it easier to hit targets with rockets) and to get away from enemies. Secondly, against Genji, Reaper and Mei this item really helps to break the distance and at the same time inflict at least some damage if you are caught off guard. Plus, you'll stop dying from your own rockets exploding, isn't that a wonderful item?\n\nGood luck in your games, because you will definitely need luck to get more direct hits with your rockets!\n \nAnd let's all hope that the developers will make a rework of the Soldier in this mode, because playing in a casino with rockets every 6 seconds is not the best Hero Fantasy. And also take a look at my post on reddit about how deplorable the situation of the soldier in the Stadium is now, and how inevitable his next nerf is:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1kdhyr0/the_only_viable_build_for_soldier_76_in_stadium/",
