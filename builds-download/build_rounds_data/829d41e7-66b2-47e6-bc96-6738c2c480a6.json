        "notes": "The essence of this build is going to revolve around Ability Power and Attack Speed and is catered specifically to very high maintained and burst healing. The core of this build is completed by Round 3 and can pivot in a number of ways to better suit the needs of your team by a game to game basis, I will be providing a full round 7 build specifically designed for the highest healing possible (I was able to do 11,000 healing on Round 7, and had more healing than every other support combined, while still being able to play offensively when needed)\n\nThe Play Style: This works best in the front line with your Tank, falling back or pushing forward to heal your DPS or other Support when needed. Try to stay out of Line of Sight as much as possible either by using your Tank as the meat shield they are, or by staying behind cover. In Round 1 you will need to replenish your Biotic Energy by using your Secondary Fire but don\u2019t get too greedy trying to push. You can use your Orbs for damage  and Energy regeneration when you need to as well, if you see a cluster of enemies, but I typically use them as either ranged or burst healing when needed.",
