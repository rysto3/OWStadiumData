        "notes": "Round 1 - Getting Started\n\nSo you want to to become a machine gun? This is how it starts.\n\nIt's orbin time - this is your main power yoy have to get early. Due to the the low health of enemies, in the early game 8 orbs can absolutely melt squishies. However be careful when charging as early on it can take 3/5 longer than usual to fully charge your secondary fire.\n\nWeapon grease - This is your most important perk, we want to build up our attack speed as quickly as we possibly can to reduce charge up time on secondary fire and to apply constant pressure to the enemies with primary fire.\n\nPower playback- This is important for giving that extra bit of healing to your tank early in the game while we have no other powers to support us with healing.\n\nPlaystyle -\nSurviving is your best friend here. Play back with your dps to allow them to peel if you get dived and try and look for opportunities to pick of squishies when possible. From now until round 7 we want to be keeping our harmony orb on the tank as much as possible to give them constant healing and letting our other support help heal the DPS.",

You will often see in round 2 people feeling much more confident, and sometimes too confident. The plan this round is to play slightly more aggressive and to apply constant pressure to the enemies. However with our increased attack speed look to punish anybody who makes a mistake or over-extends. Your pure speed will either kill them or put them down low enough for someone else to finish them easily.

        "notes": "Round 3 - the healing sentry \n\nThis is where this build begins to show its true power.\n\nPower - enlightenment\nThis is our key to winning the game. This power turns 35% of our damage done into extra healing for our harmony orb target. With our insane amount of attack speed, we can give consistent healing to our team (but especially our tank) just by doing damage to the enemy team, allowing our tank to stay alive whilst cycling their cool downs.\n\nVolskaya Ordnance - everything has more health than zenyata with how much of a glass canon he is. So taking this perk allows us to capitalise on that. This is especially important if you see the enemy tank going for a high health build as we can start doing insane amount of damage to them in a very short amount of time.\n\nExtra money? No problem! -\nIf you find that you have had a good first few rounds and have some money to spare I would recommend ammo reserves or weapon grease. Base it off of how the game is going. But extra ammo can be very helpful in reducing the amount of times that you need to reload.\n\nPlaystyle -\nNow we are getting into the nitty gritty of this build. You need to start being confident in your ability and aim and playing aggressive. We need to punish anyone out of position or who is vulnerable and make sure that we are doing consistent damage to the tank to keep them from getting any space. Keep your harmony orb on your tank and keep them alive because remember, any damage you do will be transfered into healing and more than likely the tank is going to need that more than the DPS. Your other support should be powefull enough to keep your dps alive and healed so they can continue to deal out damage along side you.",

It gives you that extra 5% weapon power which will make a difference I'm the amount of damage and healing you do and can be a big help to healing keep your tank alive.\n\nPlaystyle -\nYour are now reaching your potential. We have a massive amount of attack speed and have the potential to cause a lot of havoc to the enemy team. We are playing a lot how we did before with punishing out of positioned players but we should expect resistance now after our last round. We should keep an eye out for reapers and genjis trying to pick us of and it is imperative that you are ready and are watching their cooldowns as much as you possibly can.\n\nReaper - reaper is fairly easy to deal with, try and keep him at a distance and if you can get a charged secondary fire on him when he attempts to dive then it will force him to wraith away leaving you a nice window to continue with you machine gun duties! If he finishes his wraith in a bad position then he immediately should be become a priority target for you as taking a reaper out of the equation can help keep your backing safe.\n\nGenji - he is harder to deal with. Try and pepper shots into him where possible. ONLY USE A CHARGED SHOT WHEN YOU KNOW HE HAS NO DEFLECT. Zens charged shots are fairly easy to predict and so only use them when you know the genji can't send them straight back to you.",

        "notes": "Round 5 - adapting your strategy\nHere is where you can start to deviate from the pathway a bit depending on what your team needs.\n\nPower - Seeking Salvation \nThis is my personal favourite and my recommendation for this build. This allows yoy to follow up on your damage very easily and finish off kills that are retreating or trying to get away. The homing secondary fires are also great as because of how quickly they charge they are a reliable finishing tool for kills.\n\nGotta have faith - \nThis is also a strong pick if you are playing with a dive tank such as diva as it means you can continue to heal her for longer as she is going for dives without you having to chase her down in order to keep her in your LOS\n\nThree tap tommy-gun -\nThis gives you attack speed and ability power that can be very useful for increased healing. It also continues to build up your attack speed making you even more dangerous.\n\nSalvaged slugs - \nThis is also a viable option instead of three tap tommy-gun if you are playing against any sort of shield tank. It can be great to help breakdown tanks protection and get access to their backline.\n\nPlaystyle -\nThis depends on which power you went for but if you did go for Seeking salvation, don't be afraid to peek corners to finish of kills, keep your aggression and keep the pressure on and your on your way to winning, however keep a eye out for those dive heroes as you don't want to be caught out of position this late in the game",

The main use of these is just to try and keep you alive longer and to help you in 1v1s\n\nCommanders clip -\nThis is the cherry on the cake. This gives you 40% extra ammo which allows you more consistency and less downtime which is great for all situations, just keep an eye in your ammo to make sure you don't get stuck in a situation where you think you have more ammo than you do.\n\nPlaystyle -\nKill them all. Your tank will be getting lots of healing and if you made it to round 7 you are basically a threat to anyone you can see. Don't be overconfident and get into bad positions but don't be afraid to take 1v1s and take down enemy DPS with your fire rate. Have fun gunning the enemy down without any mercy and a loverly little play of the game to finish things off.",
