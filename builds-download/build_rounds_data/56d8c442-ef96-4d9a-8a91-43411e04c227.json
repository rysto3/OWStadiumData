        "notes": "The extra 50 HP and great passives are far more helpful than slightly more damage. I usually like to pick  [Winning Attitude](item_8714087c-c078-4619-a2ef-327bc6edaa69) and  [Siphon Gloves](item_099f8177-c2a4-4e13-b321-99349f8b1eb7) and are going to be very useful for the majority of the game, but  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) is a good pick too\n\nGet used to weaving melees between every right click as long as your target is close enough. Hefty chunk of damage and heals you for a bit too. The damage and healing add up very quickly\n\nThe boost to our quick melee from  [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900)  may not sound huge but it now gives us 65 base damage, which is more damage than our Swift Strike already, and will scale very well in to the late game for our burst combos. \n\nNote that the lifesteal from  [Hidden Blade](item_a820416d-85e5-4018-b20a-dc1cbf744900)  also works on our ultimate as it encompasses all \"melee\" damage. This is extremely helpful for keeping yourself alive during blade. The extra 25 damage is not included as our ultimate is not specifically a \"quick\" melee.",

The WP and AP scaling on your ult are additive, while melee scaling is multiplicative. So if we have 20% AP and 20% WP and  [Ambusher Optics](item_742c3c71-17cd-4fa7-bf18-ddeae7d521ca)  the (1 + 0.2 + 0.2) x 1.25 = 75% more ult damage.\n\nSell a 1.5k health item if you are full on slots\n\nIf you are really fed then you can get  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429)  now, or even  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b)  if you are REALLY REALLY fed.",

        "notes": "At this point there a lot of things that can potentially one-shot us such as Soldier Rockets, Queen Axes, and Cassidy simply left clicking, so it is very necessary to start building survivability.\n\n [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) combines with  [Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca) to give us lots of overhealth and make ourselves much tankier. Gain small amounts of overhealth from dash damage, but crucially also from crits, including backstab crits. At this points we can get 80+ health back from one backstab\n\n [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) is your single best damage item for this build, but very expensive, even if it is worth it. You may have to settle for a cheaper WP item. You can still fairly easily get to 30%-40% WP with cheaper items like  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) ,  [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f) ,  [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) , and  [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448) . This should still be enough to quickly burst down non-tanks. \n\nIf you are already finding yourself getting ones shot then priortize  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) now over high damage items like  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b).\n\nWhile your total WP may not sound especially high, note that we combo it with high melee damage and at this point  [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) will start adding a lot of extra damage to our combos.",

[Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c)  is a great item on its own but with our build's playstyle, you often will be in too dangerous of positions to take advantage of the healing, as you are still taking all of the burst damage.",

        "notes": "At this point with  [Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca), \n [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) , and  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) , it is better to keep ourselves alive by doing more damage to get more lifesteal/overhealth, and killing our enemies more quickly before they have a chance to do more damage in the first place, so we are going to round out the build with as WP as possible.\n\n [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) is your second best damage item behind  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b), but very expensive so if you do not have enough cash then  [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448) ,  [Codebreaker](item_caa96c7e-655f-4d03-9bd9-0f41937fec27) ,  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) , are all cheaper alternatives that are only slightly less effective\n\nFor your final power, you can really pick what ever you want as just about anything is viable to your preference. \n\nMost of the time I would prefer  [Wyrm\u2019s Maw](item_5d8c3488-13a9-432a-987e-275522f68cc4) for the extra burst damage on our dash combos as we have 20% AP in our completed build to do decent damage. \n\n [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d) the alternative I usually go with to help cash the likes of Mercy, Freja, and Juno who can easily fly out of range of your blade\n\n [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168) is another great option if you are good with it that I want to give a mention to. This is a fantastic power that is so good that you can create an entire build and playstyle around it, but the blade swing is very choreographed and has a lot ways to outplay that will be exploited by higher ranked players, so if you are not used to using it then it will actually interrupt the follow up on your deflect if your target dodges the blade. Regardless of that it can still do a ton of damage and should be considered if you are practiced with it.",
