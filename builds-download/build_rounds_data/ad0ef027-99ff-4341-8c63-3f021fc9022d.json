It still gives us an attack speed boost, but also builds on the idea of [Pulse Converter](item_a93a8a8e-28d1-4b02-8d80-3234f9eea3dc). It helps you take advantage of characters that are out of position.\n\nIf you're going to replace any items because you don't have enough to afford these, try to grab ones with attack speed increase or magazine increase. \n\nIf you're farming more points than I've allocated, [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) can be really useful already if you can swap it out for a blue. It gets the buff from both helix rockets you shoot via your [Double Helix](item_808afc07-1398-4962-bf2c-f8e3b74014e3) Power, and still gives attack speed.",

This perk also pairs really well with the mini visor power since you won't miss those next 3 bullets.\n\nPlaystyle: You should now be at a point where you can take HUGE advantage of out of position low health targets. If you can get a Mercy damage boost/zen discord orb, you can use helix rocket and your short tac-visor and eliminate a support character instantly. \n\nWith all your damage you can apply to shields, the enemy tank will need to play more passive or try to push all the way to you to stop your pressure. So, keep a good distance while applying pressure at least until their shield is low. If they play more passive, it should allow you to kill their support characters pretty easily.",
