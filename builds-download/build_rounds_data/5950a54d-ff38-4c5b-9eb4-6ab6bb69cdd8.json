I mitigate this problem by choosing Martian Mender. It seems like a low amount to constantly heal every second, but if you have my exact build, you'll always be healing about 10.7 heals every second, while having even lower cooldowns, letting you throw even more orbs as necessary.",

        "notes": "Round 7 is tough because you could be already maxed out on how many heals and DPS you do every round. Pick whatever ability YOU prefer by this point, adjusting to whatever your team needs.\n\nFlanker annoying you and you backline? Deconstruction can help give you that last bit of DPS you need to finish them off after healing your teammates.\n\nTeam allergic to the point and keep running off? Heal them over time with Precarious Potency.\n\nItem-wise, pick what you need. More orbs? Cooldown reduction. Need more heals? Weapon power. Maybe faster damage/heals with your hands? Weapon speed. Adjust as necessary and WIN! I usually choose Hardlight Accelerator to get more cooldown reduction and weapon power.\n\n\nPro Tip: If you've made if this far, here are some Moira tips.\n- Figure out angles and how to bank your orbs off walls. This can get you some sneaky damage and get free money.\n- Learn to figure out which orb to prioritize even with the power that throws both.\n- For the love of literally everything holy, learn to PRIORITIZE HEALING YOUR OTHER HEALER. WTF IS WITH ALL THESE CRAPPY MOIRAS NOT HEALING THEIR OTHER HEALER, YALL ARE TERRIBLE.\n- Don't get too greedy in Stadium. The rounds/games are short, so choosing between staying alive while keeping the points vs getting 1 kill but dying way off point, allowing the enemy to push in, STAY ALIVE AND ON POINT.",
