Keep in mind you still need to be healing ! What I like to do with this build though is that instead of DMG amp, I do dmg myself.\n\n## Items\n\nYou want to pick  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0)  because it increases your healing **output**.  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)  increases how **fast** you heal.  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da)  is so you can stay **alive** a bit more and regenerate your HP quickly during fights. If you prefer/are more used to it, you can grab  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) instead, but 25 shields + faster regen is better in general AND you're gonna want to keep  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)  and  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) no matter which survivability perk you choose.\n\n\n## Items NOT to pick\n\n- Literally anything in Ability Power. Anything with Ability Power is useless to mercy because her abilities are : \"Guardian Angel\" and \"Resurrection\". Ability Power does nothing for either of these. If you pick an AP build with AP powers later in the game, it makes slightly more sense but there are better options out there than building AP on mercy.\n\n-  [Field Rations](item_46ae6709-1166-426f-bca3-97a538d3f089) :\nYou're not supposed to stay on the objective, you're supposed to stick with whoever is doing the most amount of damage.\n\n- Beginning of rounds/Death perks:\nIt's not that it's bad but there are better options out there. (+ You're not supposed to be dying as mercy so if you're dying maybe put your money in survivability over death perks)\n\n- Lifesteal/Ammo/Elimination perks: \nDuring the first round you want to play like a good little mercy so you can scope out the enemy team and then eventually build DPS mercy if that's what your team needs.",

(Even chain Evoker, which will be taken around round 3)\n\n-  [Long Distance Wings](item_8b4bafad-c8bc-4c77-bbe7-798b03920c88) :\nYou don't need Ability Power and if you REALLY need GA Range (Which you don't), wait until 3rd round to get  [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) .\n\n-  [Aerodynamic Feathers](item_03d95229-b91d-48c0-b1e3-c8075b678ef0) and  [Angeleisure Wear](item_00b53ed7-0768-442b-a2c3-8d19608c9391) :\nIf you absolutely need movement, like you can't go by without it, getting  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) paired with a green survivability perk and using the rest of your money for WP/AS is the more intelligent choice.

Like any of the purples listed, except for the movement ones that you take ONLY if you die too much.\n\n\n## Items NOT to pick\n\n- Literally anything in Ability Power. Anything with Ability Power is useless to mercy because her abilities are : \"Guardian Angel\" and \"Resurrection\". Ability Power does nothing for either of these. If you pick an AP build with AP powers later in the game, it makes slightly more sense but there are better options out there than building AP on mercy.\n\n-  [Long Distance Wings](item_8b4bafad-c8bc-4c77-bbe7-798b03920c88) :\nYou don't need Ability Power and if you REALLY need GA Range (Which you don't), wait until 3rd round to get  [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) .\n\n-  [Aerodynamic Feathers](item_03d95229-b91d-48c0-b1e3-c8075b678ef0) and  [Angeleisure Wear](item_00b53ed7-0768-442b-a2c3-8d19608c9391) :\nIf you absolutely need movement, like you can't go by without it, getting  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) paired with a green survivability perk or  [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5)  and using the rest of your money for WP/AS is the more intelligent choice. You get more movement so you automatically get less Dmg taken, and you go a lot faster.\n\n-  General:\nIn all honnesty, in general, if you're doing the DPS build, you're gonna want to get as MUCH weapon power as possible. If you're dying too much, you can still get  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) and/or  [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5) , but in general you're gonna want to position yourself better depending on what DPS/Tank they have so you die a lot less. ALSO if your team is dying too much,  [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) can be very useful, but ONLY if your team is dying too much because this is still a DPS build.",
