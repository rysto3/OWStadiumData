It is better to still start with weapon power and attack speed because of this, however we will transition into ability power items later when you get  [First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d) and can transition into items to aid rez. \n\nYou do not need to start  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) but I do think it's generally better than the alternatives because it's just constant value whereas the other options only help you during rez, valk, etc. \n\n[Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) is the only other power I would consider in the first round, but it's very situational. Eliminations give you a LOT of Stadium Cash so theoretically if you are building valk fast and using this power to help secure elims during the round, you could earn more Stadium Cash than with  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9). Pick this first if you believe you can get a decent amount of elims in the first and second round. \n\nYou can replace  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) with  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) if needed.",

        "notes": "Prioritize defensive items this round if you do not already have any. Do not ever build full glass cannon unless you are in low ranks or if for some reason the enemy team is not focusing you at all, but even then it is still better to build defensively. Constantly needing to fly to health packs, your other support for healing, or just fall back to regen will hinder your ability to help your team and farm Stadium Cash. \n\nIf you have extra Stadium Cash, prioritize more CDR or survivability. High ability power is really not necessary in this build.  [First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d) gives insane amounts of overhealth with very little ability power and  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) has such low scaling already that it isn't worth dumping into. Being able to spam guardian angel thus proccing  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) constantly while staying alive will result in much more healing.\n\nYou can swap  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) for  [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5) here if you prefer it. I tend to gravitate towards  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) because it is cheaper and also offers health. Ultimately you will end up building both of these items, but it's up to you which you build first. In terms of buffing  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) HPS, I imagine they are relatively the same.  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) allows you to make a lot of distance, thus usually hitting the max amount of healing each guardian angel and  [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5) allows you to use guardian angel more often.",

        "notes": "The next epic items you buy this round and round 7 are situational and should be bought based on need. I will explain when and why to buy all items I believe are viable in this build below. \n\n[Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) will be your most common buy on this round. It gives good CDR and helps you get off a rez that would've otherwise been too risky especially considering you lack survivability when you are not moving. \n\n[Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) can help give you a little more healing. Since guardian angel is so spammable in this build, you can flick your beam to heal every time you use guardian angel to proc this. \n\n[Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) is the top defensive option here if you find yourself taking a lot of burst damage. This will not make you able to tank any and all damage, but it will give you enough time to safely reposition yourself between bursts of damage. Only buy this item when you already have an item to help mitigate damage like [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016)  [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) or  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) \n\n[Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) can be good as a final item in the build to give you some more survivability. I recommend this item when you find yourself taking a little bit of poke damage and not when you are really struggling to survive. \n\n[Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) can be really nice when your DPS are good or you find yourself able to use damage boost often. The 50 armor is also really nice.",

        "notes": "Refer to round 6 notes for explanations of all viable epic items. If you have less than 60k, once again prioritize defensive items first if you are struggling to stay alive. If you do not need more survivability, focus on CDR items like  [Multi-Tool](item_5ba8d94e-f2f3-44b7-8773-025fc6ed7c56) and  [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) \n\n[Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) can be replaced, but because this is an ability power build many of the standard options are fairly weak here. \n\n[Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) synergies well with  [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) but the healing beam generally sees less use in this build anyways because you have no weapon power. Nonetheless duel beams is still very strong. \n\n[Distortion](item_5557e2f2-02df-4eac-8128-0c23b71183b1) I only pick when my team generally built well and are not being one shot. As you probably know, this does not happen often, but it's worth to keep in mind for when it does! Pairs nicely with  [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) too.\n\n[Protective Beam](item_3f1ef995-8ecc-45fb-8b57-26fdccc21feb) is honestly just not very good. I really think they needed to make this power work above like 60% HP at least for it to be good. It's still a solid option if your team is often very healthy, generally if your other support built to heal. I usually only take this if I need to abuse double beam length in valk to stay alive and/or  [Distortion](item_5557e2f2-02df-4eac-8128-0c23b71183b1) isn't a viable option that match. \n\n[Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) feels so cursed to pick last, but if I have a team that plays close together and I'm able to push damage boost to multiple targets, it's definitely a good option. \n\nThe rest of the powers are honestly just not worth mentioning in this build as they are either reliant on weapon power or are just complete throw picks like  [Equivalent Exchange](item_82826007-bdfd-4bba-a04a-2f67e6eb7169)",

Alternatively Divine Intervention is better into high burst teams if you have more cash. Angeleisure Wear is the superior option in matchups where you find yourself having a lot of airtime with angelic descent or are spamming guardian angel often and taking mostly poke damage.",
