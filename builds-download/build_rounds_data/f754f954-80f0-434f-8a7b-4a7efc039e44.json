It gives you an additional torpedo charge, making it easier to pressure space, heal, and do damage. The increased utility lets you build momentum while staying safe, which plays into your overall goal of healing, debuffing, and surviving through longer fights.\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Alternative Powers:\n**Hyper Healer** \u2013 For matchups where your team lacks sustain or is struggling to survive early engagements, Hyper Healer is a great fallback. It shifts your role into full support, allowing you to carry healing pressure early on. This is also very helpful when going against someone who can counter Juno's torpedoes easily.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Item Picks \u2013 Round 1:\n\n**First Aid Kit**\nCore to Juno\u2019s sustain. Lets you stay on the field with your team longer and provides extra protection.\n\n**Shady Spectacles**\nKeeps you on the field longer, grants you lifesteal when you hit an enemy with your torpedoes.\n\n**Power Playbook**\nIncreases the power of your torpedoes and orbital ray, which will, in turn, increase healing and damage.",

If you chose Hyper Healer in Round 1, the synergy here is powerful: the enemy team is slowed, while yours stays up and healthy. This combo often turns fights in your favor.\nItem: **Solar Shielding**\nAdds shielding and survivability to your Hyper Ring build.

If you're aiming for full area denial and control, this stacks beautifully with Cosmic Coolant and turns choke points into lockdown zones.\n\n\ud83c\udf00 Hyper Ring Build Path\nItem: **Martian Mender**\nIncreases Hyper Ring uptime and boosts your own healing over time. This means more healing during and between fights and better sustain for both yourself and your team. A fantastic late-game support investment that lets you stay in the fight and keep your allies alive longer.\n\n\u2600\ufe0f Optional Utility Items (Works in Either Build):\n**Sunburst Serum**\nAdds bonus healing when using your ultimate, and grants extra shielding. This item scales especially well with Hyper Healer or during clutch ult moments in either build.\n\n**Fort-Glide**\nGrants damage reduction while using Glide Boost, and provides extra shielding. This adds survivability in aggressive fights or when rotating between objectives. A solid pick for both zoning and support builds when you need to stay alive longer.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 General Late-Game Strategy (If You\u2019re Ahead Economically):\nFor **Torpedo Builds**, stack **ability power** where possible to boost zoning pressure, healing output, and debuff potency.\n\nFor **Hyper Ring Builds**, lean toward **weapon power and healing amps** to push your supportive impact even further.",

Medicinal Missiles lets you heal while firing fewer torpedoes, increasing your efficiency and reducing energy strain. It keeps your healing consistent even while zoning or brawling, allowing you to pressure and sustain at the same time.\n\nItem: **Liquid Nitrogen** (if not already taken)\nSlows enemies hit by torpedoes, enhancing your ability to control enemy movement and keep them stuck in your zoning fields. A great combo with Cosmic Coolant and Cyber Venom for full crowd-control pressure.\n\nItem: **Sunburst Serum**\nAdds bonus healing during your ultimate and gives extra shields. This gives you a powerful teamfight edge, keeping both you and your team alive during critical ult usage, especially useful in drawn-out objective fights.\n\n\ud83c\udf00 Hyper Ring Build Path\nPower: **Rally Ring**\nThis power dramatically increases Hyper Ring uptime, boosting your overall healing output and keeping your team healthy during long engagements. When combined with Martian Mender, Solar Shielding, and Hyper Healer, this turns you into a frontline support tank that\u2019s incredibly hard to dislodge.\n\n(Items this round would typically stay the same as Round 4: Martian Mender, Solar Shielding, Sunburst Serum [optional], or Fort-Glide, depending on needs.)",

Pulsar Destroyer adds a massive ability power boost and increases the damage enemies take from your torpedoes, making them even deadlier. At this stage, it turns you into a serious threat, not just a zoner, but a finisher.\n\nAlternative Item: **Pulse Spike**\nIncreases the speed of your torpedoes, making it harder for enemies to dodge and giving you more reliable hits. This is a great pick if you\u2019re struggling to land abilities or need faster pressure in fast-paced fights.\n\n\ud83e\uddc3 Optional Items:\n**Nano Cola** \u2013 Big boost to ability power, which supercharges both your healing and damage.\n**Champion\u2019s Kit** \u2013 Another excellent ability power boost, often picked when you're ahead and want to dominate fights with raw numbers.\n\n\ud83c\udf00 Hyper Ring Build Path:\nFocus on: **Survivability** & **Weapon Power**\nIf you're running Rally Ring or Hyper Healer, Round 6 should reinforce your role as a team anchor.\nIf you're struggling to stay alive: go for defensive or sustain-focused items (like Fort-Glide, Rejuvenator, or Nano Cola if it has healing bonuses).\nIf you're safe and want more healing output: stack weapon power for increased Mediblaster effectiveness and Hyper Ring ticks.\nReminder: You\u2019ve already built a strong support base with Martian Mender, Solar Shielding, and possibly Sunburst Serum \u2014 Round 6 is for fine-tuning based on how aggressive or defensive your team needs you to be.",

When paired with Cosmic Coolant and Medicinal Missiles, this turns you into a healing artillery platform \u2014 zoning enemies, reducing their healing, and sustaining your team in the process.\n\nItems:\nStick with your Round 6 items (Cyber Venom, Biotech Maximizer, Sunburst Serum, Liquid Nitrogen, etc.).\n\n\ud83d\udd01 Flex Option: If any items feel like they\u2019re underperforming or situational value has dropped, swap them for pure ability power items like **Nano Cola or Champion\u2019s Kit **to further boost damage and healing scaling.\n\n\ud83c\udf00 Hyper Ring Build Path\nPower: **Orbital Alignment**\nOrbital Alignment slows enemies inside its field while speeding up your team \u2014 giving you both defensive and offensive mobility control. When paired with Rally Ring, Hyper Healer, and your healing-focused items, this turns you into a high-impact support anchor that excels in both tempo and sustain.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Items:\nKeep most of your Round 6 items (**Martian Mender, Solar Shielding, Sunburst Serum, etc.**)\n\nIf needed, trade weaker utility items for:\n\nWeapon Power items (e.g., for more Mediblaster healing)\n\nDefensive survivability items if you're being targeted in teamfights",
