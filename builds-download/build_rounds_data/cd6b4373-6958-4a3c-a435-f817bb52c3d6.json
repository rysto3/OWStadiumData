We will use threads of fate to maximize healing and damage boost output.\n\nAlways keep your beam attached to 2 teammates. Do your best to stay alive, heal damage, and boost damage as much as you can. The less you die, the more cash you will earn.\n\nAdditionally, we will take Compensator and Weapon Grease to improve healing efficiency (more healing = more credits), as well as armored vest. Try to prioritize armor over shield health when playing mercy. Mercy easily heals off damage taken with this build, and shield health does not provide any additional damage reduction.\n\nYou won't be very tanky in the beginning rounds, so play cover as much as possible until later rounds.",

Commit to this build if you notice enemies are focusing you a lot, if you are getting eliminated too easily, or if you simply decide you want to be an unkillable moth.\n\nThis round you will choose Serenity, which improves your Sympathetic Recovery Passive.\n\nSerenity allows for you to always receive healing while your heal beam is attached to an ally, and heals you for 60% of your healing output. This STACKS with threads of fate!\n\nAny time you take damage, immediately begin healing your allies. Staying alive is key to winning! Healbotting is encouraged (as long as you or your allies need healing, otherwise you should be damage boosting!)\n\nThis round you should buy Nebula Conduit. This item takes 15% of ALL damage you take and disperses it over the next 3 seconds. This item is amazing against burst damage heroes and synergizes perfectly with Serenity. Any damage you take over time will now be easily healed off via Serenity.\n\nI typically buy Nebula Conduit first as it provides a little bit of extra weapon power as well.\n\nYou will now have damage reduction via armor health and Nebula Conduit.\n\nAny extra credits should be used to improve your weapon power.",

        "notes": "Round 4!\n\nYour priority this round is to buy Ogundimu Reduction Field(ORF).\n\nThis round you should feel a noticeable difference in your tanking abilities.\n\nOgundimu Reduction Field gives you a stacking damage reduction for every instance of damage you take. Damage reduction is applied for 1 second, and will stack up to a total of 10%\n\nORF Synergizes PERFECTLY with Nebula Conduit and Serenity. The dispersed damage you take with Nebula Conduit charges up your stacking damage reduction via ORF. All of this damage can be easily healed off with Serenity.\n\nAny remaining credits should be used to upgrade your weapon power. More healing = improved usefulness for your teammates AND more self-healing.\n\nIf you have lots of extra credits, you could consider selling weapon power items to buy Amari's Antidote. If don't have enough for that, buy whatever you can afford from the optional list I provided. If you need more healing, prioritize weapon power. If you need more survivability (highly doubt you will need it) buy Crusader Hydraulics!\n\nThis round you should be able to stand in front of teammates to tank some damage, stall objectives while healing allies, and even potentially survive solo-ultimates.\n\nTo give you an idea of your total damage reduction, here's an example:\n\n(Amor health reduces beam damage by 30%)\n\nAgainst Zarya:\nArmor Health (30%)+Nebula Conduit(15%)+Ogundimu Reduction Field(10%)=55% Damage Reduction\n\nCombo that damage reduction with your self-healing via Serenity and you become an unkillable monster :)",

This is very useful because you can now rez allies in enemy backlines or poor positions without worrying about them immediately exploding following their resurrection.\n\nIf you don't feel as if your team needs extra survivability via First-Responder, you could instead get Crepuscular Circle for an extra strong ultimate!\n\nFor items this round, prioritize buying Chain Evoker for extra armor health and improved damage boosting capabilities!\n\nAny remaining credits should be used to improve healing/weapon power.\n\nGet items in this order if you have enough credits: Amari's Antidote, Talon Modification Module, Advanced Nanobiotics, Compensator, Weapon Grease.",

        "notes": "Final Round!\n\nI typically get Crepuscular Circle this round, as it is Mercy's strongest power for enabling teammates. This power synergizes with Serenity really well, as every beam healing a teammate will regenerate Mercy's HP.\n\nYou could also consider getting Glass-Extra-Full, since you will be healing a lot with this build in order to tank damage and stall objectives. Sometimes your secondary beam target will be full health while you are healing your primary target. This power will allow your full-health teammates to receive over-health, so you won't have to feel bad about healbotting to keep yourself alive :)\n\nIn this final round, I choose what I need most. If I want stronger heals, I get Eye of the Spider or Hardlight Accelerator. If I want more self-sustain I get Martian Mender.\n\nHere is how much SELF-HEALING you can get if you choose Eye of the Spider as your final item:\n\nWithout Valkyrie (target NOT under half health):\nPrimary Heal Beam Target: 52.2HPS\nSecondary Heal Beam Target: 26.1 HPS\nTotal: 78.3 HPS\n\nWithout Valkyrie (Targets BOTH under half-health):\nPrimary Heal Beam Target: 57.6HPS\nSecondary Heal Beam Target: 28.8HPS\nTotal: 86.4HPS\n\nSelf-Healing While in Valkyrie (no targets under half-health):\nEach Ally Healed: 56.55HPS (Max 4 for 226.2)\nSelf-Healing Valkyrie Passive: 36.6HPS (10 health + 5% total health per second)\nTotal: 262.8 Healing Per-Second (WOW!!)\n\nCombo this self-healing per second with your stacking damage reduction and insane mobility (and good use of cover), and you'll become the unkillable moth of your dreams!",
