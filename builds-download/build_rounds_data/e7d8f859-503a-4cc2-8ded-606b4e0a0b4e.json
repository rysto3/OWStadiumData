Some people argue for  [Frost Armor](item_f9925f6e-bb6a-4de6-bb86-622583d60779) for survivability, but if you play positioning correct you wont need it.\n\nThe reason we pick up  [Extendothermics](item_501fc89f-a7b4-46c5-a43f-b65ab0958438) is to farm credits. Combining  [Extendothermics](item_501fc89f-a7b4-46c5-a43f-b65ab0958438) with  [Frenzy Amplifier](item_d4b0cfcb-14e9-4472-a688-680120217250) snowballs credits really well.\n\n [Extendothermics](item_501fc89f-a7b4-46c5-a43f-b65ab0958438)  allows us to hit people with our primary fire from up to 16m.  [Frenzy Amplifier](item_d4b0cfcb-14e9-4472-a688-680120217250) helps us build a kill streak after getting a kill. Combines these two together ( [Extendothermics](item_501fc89f-a7b4-46c5-a43f-b65ab0958438) for reaching and consistently hitting people and  [Frenzy Amplifier](item_d4b0cfcb-14e9-4472-a688-680120217250) to snowball kills together) and you become an absolute credit farm.\n\n# ITEMS\n\nAs we already talked about it the power section,  [Frenzy Amplifier](item_d4b0cfcb-14e9-4472-a688-680120217250) is purely here to help us snowball kills and therefore credits.\n\n [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) is simply here to help us secure kills. The 5% weapon boost will actually make more of a difference than you think.\n\n [Plasma Converter](item_25869f9a-9a29-4e19-96b6-9d8a28c59318) is our survivability for round 1. Because were going to be constantly using primary fire to snowball kills, the 10% life steal from  [Plasma Converter](item_25869f9a-9a29-4e19-96b6-9d8a28c59318) will help tremendously in keeping us alive. \n\n# PLAYSTYLE\n\nFor round 1, just play regular Mei.\n\nUse primary fire to disrupt pushes because of its slow effect. Because of your primary fire's 16m range, you can also use it to shoot down any low squishy's in their backline.\n\nUse secondary fire (if you have good aim with it) to disrupt any of their characters that like to sit on highground, ie.  [Ashe](hero_37b42a2d-a82d-4a22-9df2-4c812c873b54),  [Junkrat](hero_3ac20f6c-2bce-45f3-998e-9129cc6e5c05),  [Soldier: 76](hero_e1ac7ef5-4648-4998-b8b0-9e3da3e60546).\n\nUse icicle to survive, obviously. However there is another really strong use case for icicle. If your being chased down then run as far and fast as you can from the main fight. Once you almost die then pop icicle. 9/10 times the person who was chasing you will wait for you to pop out. This will just entirely remove them from the main fight. You also have a good chance of killing them afterwards.\n\nUse wall to disrupt pushes, separate the enemy team, or survive. Using wall to disrupt pushes is really powerful. For example you just won a team fight and the enemy is rushing back to touch point. Simply wall them off and win the round. You can also use wall to separate the enemy team. This usually means walling behind their tank to make him an easy pick. The final use for your wall is to survive. Whether you simply walling yourself off  from the enemy team, or throwing your wall under you to escape sticky situations, the wall has great survivability potential.\n\nUse your ult to win team fights or disrupt pushes. Your ult is a team fight turner. Simply ulting just their tank can win you a lot of fights. Obviously catching more people in your ult is ideal however. My favorite use case for the ult is stopping pushes. Like the wall, if the enemy team is running to touch site simply throw your ult in the chokepoint to win the round. Or if your on push in overtime simply throw your ult on the bot. They can either contest the bot and get frozen, or run from the bot and lose overtime.",

Pick up  [Frost Armor](item_f9925f6e-bb6a-4de6-bb86-622583d60779) to account for this.  [Frost Armor](item_f9925f6e-bb6a-4de6-bb86-622583d60779) synergizes very well with  [Extendothermics](item_501fc89f-a7b4-46c5-a43f-b65ab0958438).\n\n [Extendothermics](item_501fc89f-a7b4-46c5-a43f-b65ab0958438) allows you to primary fire people without risk while  [Frost Armor](item_f9925f6e-bb6a-4de6-bb86-622583d60779) builds your survivability to counter the power spikes most builds achieve.\n\n# ITEMS\n\nPick up  [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f) because of its ability to not only let us get kills easier with its 10% weapon power, but also its 5% cooldown reduction which can really come in clutch for survivability.\n\n [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) is a core item in this build. Never sell  [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) from this point on. Not only does it provide 25 armor which is amazing for survivability, but it also gives us 10% reduced weapon damage. I cannot stress how important this is for survivability, especially when we start flanking.\n\n [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016) is also really important here, adding up to 110 armor to us. Obviously this is great for survivability.\n\n [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) is another great pickup here, totaling our total armor this round to 160 which will already make you annoying to kill on only round 3.\n\nIf you have an extra $3500 to spare replace  [Plasma Converter](item_25869f9a-9a29-4e19-96b6-9d8a28c59318) with  [Technoleech](item_cb7fd8bf-bdcc-439a-ad35-372f24a027a8) for even more damage potential without losing out on any survivability.\n\n# PLAYSTYLE\n\nOnce again play regular Mei, but since you have so much survivability this round you can get a bit more aggressive. Start focusing more on squishy characters and try to take them down.",

Once you build up your ult to 100% charge taking 1v1s will be a breeze.\n\nYou will have extra money in this round almost inevitably, so here's some extra items you can pick up listed in highest to lowest priority based on how much money you have.\n\n [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) is one of the best survivability items in the game currently. It's a must pick for survivability if you have the money.\n\n [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) is a close second. Providing you with lots of life steal and other survivability perks including adding to your health pool.\n\n [Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) is another great survivability item, helping you survive more against burst builds, ie.  [Soldier: 76](hero_e1ac7ef5-4648-4998-b8b0-9e3da3e60546),  [Junker Queen](hero_4794d288-27d9-49e0-a1dd-ffe0f4de3ab1),  [Freja](hero_e80840a1-845d-4008-966c-585b7cb4a424),  [Juno](hero_035c63b7-084c-4abd-9de5-c9a00e9b6a18),  [Ana](hero_f1aee6cf-704f-455f-a100-ec882ebbe000), and  [Cassidy](hero_3dd63854-7558-4344-86e4-b506f807129b).\n\n [Technoleech](item_cb7fd8bf-bdcc-439a-ad35-372f24a027a8) is another good pickup. We've already talked about it so I won't go in depth. If you don't have enough money to buy it on its own then replace it with  [Plasma Converter](item_25869f9a-9a29-4e19-96b6-9d8a28c59318).\n\nIf you don't have enough money for any of these that's ok, they're just extras.\n\n# PLAYSTYLE\n\nPlay like you have been until you build your ult to 100% charge. Once you have your ult start taking some 1v1s and going for their backline a bit. Were still in the first half of the game so don't over aggress to hard.",

The main purpose we pick up  [Coulder](item_12ad88e8-650a-44ec-b1e1-a39646055d68) is to be able to freely reposition out of their backline while your flanking. Pretty much as soon as all of your overhealth/shields/armor is gone you want to pop  [Coulder](item_12ad88e8-650a-44ec-b1e1-a39646055d68) and reposition, idealy back to your frontline.\n\n# ITEMS\n\n [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) is an amazing item for the flank playstyle. It will give you a *huge* advantage in 1v1s allowing you to win 99% of them.\n\nOnce again replace  [Plasma Converter](item_25869f9a-9a29-4e19-96b6-9d8a28c59318) with  [Technoleech](item_cb7fd8bf-bdcc-439a-ad35-372f24a027a8) if you have the money.\n\n# PLAYSTYLE\n\nWelcome to the second half of the game, or what I like to call flank half. Everything has been leading up to this and now its your time to shine. Start by building up your armor with  [Frost Armor](item_f9925f6e-bb6a-4de6-bb86-622583d60779) and building up 100% ult charge for  [Vanadium Injection's](item_57953fbc-11ff-4e92-9928-fc59b7be668f) effects, playing a little more conservative while you do. Once you have that, it is time. Dive their backline as hard as you can, picking them off one by one. Make sure to save  [Coulder](item_12ad88e8-650a-44ec-b1e1-a39646055d68) for escape to reposition back to your team. A general tip for 1v1's is to strafe aggressively while primary firing them, especially against hitscan characters.",

Were gonna need it as most builds have insane DPS by round 7.\n\n# ITEMS\n\nPick up  [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) for more survivability. Survivability on round 7 is key.\n\nSwap  [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016) with  [Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) if they're running high burst damage builds.\n\n# PLAYSTYLE\n\nYou'll need to be a little more conservative this round because of the sheer damage some builds output on round 7. Don't get me wrong though your build is still by far the best. Play almost exactly the same this round while taking into account that you might have to pop  [Coulder](item_12ad88e8-650a-44ec-b1e1-a39646055d68) more often than you think\n\n# FINAL NOTES\n\nThat's about it from me! Time for you to go rank up and show people why Mei is meta. Thank you so much for giving my build a chance and I wish you the best of luck.\n\n- P0pc0rn",
