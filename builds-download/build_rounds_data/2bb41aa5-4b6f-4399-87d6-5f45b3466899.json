Having both weapon power and attack speed together result in higher HPS, this becomes less important later when we are upgrading to epic tier items because there is a massive lack in epic attack speed items that work well with mercy's kit. In the early rounds though, it is important to prioritize both as well as consider how expensive  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) is in comparison.",

        "notes": "There are two main options I will describe below. I highly suggest the first one if you are unsure as it is never a bad option and building towards rez or pure healing in round 3 and 4 can easily result in many deaths or less Stadium Cash gained. \n\n1. Build: \n[Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) and [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1)  This combo makes you ridiculously tanky early without sacrificing too much weapon power. \nYou do not have to take  [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1)  or build  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8)  this early, but at this point in the game you will often find yourself being focused a LOT. Remember to heal full health allies with  [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) to heal yourself in case you are being focused. Focus additional weapon power and attack speed after  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8)\n\n\n2. If you believe you can survive without them and can get revives off, build:\n[Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448)  and  [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591)  Maintain  [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448)  stacks when you can, but be mindful as it requires you to spam guardian angel basically on cooldown. Don't greed the stacks if it means you could die. Replace  [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) and [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145)  with  [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f)  and [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0)  for more CDR.\n\nOptional: I do occasionally take  [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) here and build purely healing, however I don't suggest this because pure healing builds suffer when your teammates build full glass cannon (which is almost always unfortunately) and get either one shot or just die too quickly even while being healed. If you are stacking with a group and know that they will build somewhat defensively or if you have randoms that do so, then this can definitely be a good option if you don't need need the extra survivability early through  [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1). In these situations, I recommend not buying an epic item and buying   [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e)  [Mid-Air Mobilizer](item_760c1441-8cfa-426c-885d-8d0dec32e145)  [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) and  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) as this will result in much higher HPS than  [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) and one or two rare items. If you have extra cash after, buy  [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016) for survivability.",

It basically has zero value outside of rez so buy this if you cannot outheal the damage your team is taking and need to supplement with rez. \n\n[Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) is actually ridiculously overpowered in my opinion if your only struggle in staying alive. Never buy this if you don't have at least one item to help mitigate damage like an armor item or  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) as it feels awful without them. I usually take this as my second to last or last item because at that stage of the game you will absolutely be hard focused and damage will have scaled ridiculously high. \n\n[Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d)  can be bought if you still find yourself struggling to stay alive. Only buy this if you already have both [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) and  [Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) as it's difficult to max out stacks without  [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) and  [Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) is simply a better and cheaper item. \n\n[Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931)  is another great defensive item that I really like into heavy dive/flank teams as you can make a LOT of distance very quickly with this item. It's also only 9k which is a huge bonus. \n\n[Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7)  is in my opinion ridiculously situational in this build as you shouldn't need it to survive, however there are occasional games where abusing beam length is necessary so use your best judgement when buying this. \n\n[Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca)  is really good when you have decent DPS. It also gives armor which is a huge plus. It doesn't aid your healing or survivibility much so only buy when you have good DPS to abuse it. \n\n[Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5)  sounds really good on paper for this build. Buffs mobility and allows you to maintain  [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448)  stacks with ease, but this item is just so freaking clunky. 15% GA Speed is also nothing to write home about. If you like this item and are comfortable using it, go for it. If not, just ignore it. \n\n[Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124)  or  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b)  if you do not need more survivibility AND you believe you can keep your team alive with more healing. \n\n[Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e)  is in my opinion the worst option here, however it has had niche uses in certain rounds where those few seconds of rez cooldown makes a difference. The overhealth after valk can also help you get off a risky rez, but the ability power is completely useless in this build. Avoid this if you can, but it's worth buying in rare situations where your team cannot stay alive and you desperately need more CDR.  [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f)  and  [Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0)  should always be prioritized over this.",

It also synergizes really well with  [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591). If you struggle to stay alive during valk and need to abuse double beam length, avoid this. \n\n[Distortion](item_5557e2f2-02df-4eac-8128-0c23b71183b1)  is better in matches where you find yourself actually able to use dmg boost more often. Typically if your other support is building to heal their team and/or you have good DPS.\n\n[Glass Extra Full](item_659ff350-8602-42cd-b5f9-f4da7e5e912b)  synergizes pretty well with  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb). There will be many instances where your second beam is healing someone who is full health. \n\n[Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) is actually really good, but only if your team built any defensive items. You will never be able to out heal your team being one shot or bursted quickly. I do find myself rarely flying directly to a critical ally, but this is something I have gotten more used to as I've played with this power more, but is something to note.  \n\n[First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d)  is pretty much only taken here when your team is hopeless. They likely built zero defensive items, cannot stay alive and you are holding your team together through rez and require  [First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d)  to survive most rezzes.  Pairs pretty well with  [Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e) but if i find myself having to build this combo, it's usually hopeless.\n\n[Protective Beam](item_3f1ef995-8ecc-45fb-8b57-26fdccc21feb) I only suggest this power if you took triage unit round 3 and are building more healing. I tested this power a lot into one shot jq, juno two shot, and helix soldier builds thinking it would help my squishy teammates tank the initial burst and it just doesn't help. However it did feels very strong with tankier teammates weirdly enough. \n\nAny powers not mentioned are either not worth it in my opinion or complete throw picks like  [Equivalent Exchange](item_82826007-bdfd-4bba-a04a-2f67e6eb7169).",
