This bonus will not expire over time if you do not shoot anyone and it scales with ability power. \n\nSo with the first 2-3 bullets you can deal damage like with 5-6. Right after the first shots you fire Helix, and the bonus from Mark of the Kitsune activates again for the next hit if you need to finish off a target. That's why you don't need weapon damage or attack speed, just ability power.\n\nThis item, as well as the second power for Helix Rockets, create a turning point: now your build is online and you don't need survival or weapon damage because you will kill others with ability damage faster than they will kill you.. You should only look for an opportunity for an off-angle and combo, and run to safety immediately after you finish it. Repeat every 6 seconds.\n\nWhat combos am I talking about? You'll find out from the description for the next round and the notes on the items.\n\nYou can play as a flanker, or you can spam combos on the main while behind the tank: it all depends on how comfortable you are finding your opportunities and what map it is.",

You will have good unconditional damage with rockets and from  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) at 65% AP, and your ult will give you and your teammates in a radius of 25 meters 50 overhealth for 3s when activated. You will also have 10% lifesteal from rocket damage. You can call it a bet on one key moment when you will help the team survive and win. Additional info in the note to Biolight below.\n\n#### When you're short on money, there are other options:\n\n**26000**\nIf your targets have a lot of HP (400 or more), you can buy [Three-tap Tommygun](item_39c5d2a4-1db0-444f-86d9-2a1e9a331429) \n5-shot + Helix deals 354 damage; 3-shot + Helix + 3 shots deals 408 damage. Details in the note to the Three-tap.\n\n**25250**\nBuy [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) and [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e)\n5 shots + Helix under the feet does 351 damage. 3 shots + Helix + 3 shots = 411 damage.\n\n**22500**\nLife is hard for the poor, isn't it? Buy [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) and [Shady Spectacles](item_ef9bb72f-a56c-4fb6-a552-5abce0b943d7)\nThe idea is that +5% WP from Custom Stock won't change anything, but an additional 20% lifesteal from Helix's high damage can save your life.",

Usually, you just want to get the most ability power for your money, but sometimes it makes sense to think about survival. Judge based on the HP of your opponents: if they go for damage and neglect survival, then you can do the opposite, because you will definitely have enough damage to kill them faster. And vice versa.\n\nBesides the obvious items that give armor or shields, I would highlight Iron Lung, because it fits your playstyle perfectly and works not only as an overhealth, but also as a continuous heal while you are sprinting, which is very helpful for survival. You can assume that your maximum HP will not just be +25%, but +35% or even more if someone is chasing you.\n\nAs for the choice of the third Power, everything is obvious: to increase your survivability, as well as to always have the ability to press the combo \"Biotic Field - shot - Helix - shot\", you take [Track and Field](item_b3750fe4-e416-42b6-ad9e-fe92c7dcffc5)",

This is especially true against mobile, fast, flying heroes, and on maps where you have to storm high ground - in all these cases, you will often miss with rockets.\n\nMaximizing AP is a priority, because killing with rockets is much more reliable than finishing off targets with rifle shots. This may require you to close the distance to less than 10 meters to better hit with rockets and have a chance at direct hits, so it's worth thinking about survival as well.\n\nThat's why, if you have some extra money after buying all the main items, you can sacrifice a small amount of AP to buy either  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) or  [Iron Lung](item_22867dc9-50a1-4523-a77a-2fd67b487b51) \nBut only if your targets don't have a lot of HP! Both items affect your survivability differently and reduce downtime after taking damage, and both items will be in the final version of the build.\n\nAnd vice versa, if your opponents have a lot of HP, buy [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b) \n\n#### What you shouldn't buy:\n[Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505)\nonly 2s of debuff after damage from Rockets is not enough, and if the target gets a lot of healing, it won't help you anyway. It's better to deal more damage at once by increasing AP.\n[Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98)\nyou are not a support, and your rockets are needed to guarantee kills, not to put debuffs on tanks\n[Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4)\nyour ult is pretty weak, especially in the late game\n[Vanadium Injection](item_57953fbc-11ff-4e92-9928-fc59b7be668f)\nthis item will not work for half of the round, and even when it does, only AP and HP are important to you. In addition, even if your ult is weak, it makes sense to use it at the right moment or against Mercy, Juno or Lucio, because they are the hardest for you to kill.\n[Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b)\nyour targets have less than 30% HP only after the rockets explode, and therefore increasing the damage from your shots will not change much.

        "notes": "#### This is your final form!\nThe fourth Power can be whatever you like.\n\nBy default, I took two survival items into the build at once:  [Iron Lung](item_22867dc9-50a1-4523-a77a-2fd67b487b51)  and  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) \n\nYou can replace one of them with something from the list below:\n\n[Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b) adds HP and weapon damage, but the main thing is that it \n[El-sa'ka Supressor](item_b4298dd9-9b93-461f-a2e0-843402667100) with 30 rounds in the magazine, it is not difficult for the Soldier to occasionally hit the tank in the head and help the team with a debuff if at this time he cannot find a target for himself. And if you have excellent aim, then this will also help in duels, especially against Moira, Cassidy and Reaper.\n[Salvaged Slugs](item_019d6c60-36eb-42ec-8d6e-5bbb44a0db61) in theory, can help pop Zarya's bubbles faster and finish her off with direct rockets; not sure, needs more testing\n[Ironclad Exhaust Ports](item_2d085fa5-ace6-4fab-9323-b7a06268bcd0) cheap burst heal after rockets, because with Double Helix you get two uses of the ability in a row and +50hp. Very helpful in duels.\n\n[Endgame Equalizer](item_a2143111-8fa0-4e3b-bbcf-12ed54587234)  is experimental option! \nThe idea is this: immediately after using Helix, you press the ult and after 1.2 seconds you have Helix again. In this case, it makes sense to take either  [Biolight Overflow](item_1220eaec-f913-4de2-816c-0dc070b285d0) or  [Iridescent Iris](item_b7fb28ef-ce82-416b-8693-01c274f8df4e) along with this item. But keep in mind that this is an all-in option that should allow you to quickly kill 2-3 enemy heroes once per round. Very rarely will overtimes drag out the game so much that you can use two visors.\n\nSo the last thing I want to advise is not to forget about the situational item  [Bomb Diffusal Boots](item_c555901e-1b69-4040-8420-ee81cbaf6d90) during the game. The item can be useful at any stage of the game, depending on the map or the composition of the enemy team. Plus, you'll stop dying from your own rockets exploding, isn't that a wonderful item?\n\nGood luck in your games, because you will definitely need luck to get more direct hits with your rockets!",
