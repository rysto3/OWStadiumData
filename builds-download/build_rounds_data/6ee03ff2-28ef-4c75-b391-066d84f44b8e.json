        "notes": "I keep having to remake this build because I don't see a way to edit my past builds lol.\n\nBUILD NOTES: This build focuses mainly on cooldown reduction and AP. If you're a badass battle mercy, this might not be the most fun build for you, but who knows! I like this build because it lets me be somewhat passive but also gives me a lot of movement to be able to GA quickly and go for a sneaky rez. I know that people swear AP Mercy is bad in stadium, but this build provides your team so much healing through use of Threads of Fate and Whambulance. By the time you have full build your GA will be on a less than one second cooldown, and you'll be burst healing while flying around like a crackhead. \n\nBy the time you're full build you should have 40% ability power and 40% cooldown reduction! :D\n\nI will also add here that I don't recommend building this if you have two dive DPS such as Reaper and Genji, and a dive tank like JQ, but I haven't fully tested this theory yet.\n\nI KNOW IT WILL BE TEMPTING TO BUY MOVEMENT ITEMS SUCH AS BLESSED BOOSTERS OR ANGELIC ACROBATICS, BUT DON'T! Trust me, I love those items too but this build provides you with the same amount of CDR on your GA as Angelic Acrobatics, and Blessed Boosters isn't really necessary with this build.\n\nAlso, this build is just something I saw another Mercy play (shout out GothicLuna) and she's was literally unstoppable, making the enemy call her, well, an unkillable flying rat. \n\nYou don't have to follow this perfectly! I'll put in the notes of each round what items are other good options if you find you need to switch things up.\n\nPlease like the build! I appreciate it a lot :)\n \nIf you tried this build and you got stomped, it's clearly your DPS' fault. :3",
