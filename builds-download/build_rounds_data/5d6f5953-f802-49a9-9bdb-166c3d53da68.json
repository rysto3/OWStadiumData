This directly translates to more Cash, allowing you to scale and become more powerful, hopefully faster than your opponents.\n\n### Items:\nThe three Common starting items are straightforward, and directly improve Moira's damage and healing output simultaneously. In the first few rounds, you will not be able to afford the more powerful Ability items, and thus could not fully rely on your Biotic Orbs yet. Hence, you will likely be keeping a few Weapon Power and Attack Speed items for a while.\n\n[Charged Plating](item_b8ca58e7-6ae2-40ee-8618-fe2f32315295) is a good alternative to [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf), giving you a significant leg up in survivability and Ability Power as soon as you use your UItimate for the first time, which Moira charges relatively fast.",

Between the two, my personal experience has been that [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) generally screws with opponents more, especially ones that often rely on getting into close range like Reinhardt. However, use your own judgement on whether [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) might be more useful in some situations.\n\n[Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6), [Wrist Wraps](item_19183386-c859-42ca-93f2-355d47d01e36), and [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) are also good alternatives if you are strapped for cash.

Optimally, you will likely want to have your last selected Biotic Orb be a healing one; if you are spraying extensively, you are likely trying to keep your teammates alive. The extra healing Biotic Orbs can often be a gamechanger in these scenarios.\n\n### Items:\n\nAt this stage of the game, you will likely begin affording more Epic items, on top of  [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) and [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505). If you do not have those two items yet, prioritize getting them first.\n\n[Biotech Maximizer](item_01c6dcb3-d2e2-4c57-bd21-61d7b8f939c4), [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b), and [Extendrils](item_138e73a2-6915-4ffc-bd89-029a85bf94b8) are all excellent items, and can be used in the final build. Of these three, I find [Biotech Maximizer](item_01c6dcb3-d2e2-4c57-bd21-61d7b8f939c4) the most powerful, since it can dramatically increase the uptime of your Biotic Orbs by potentially reducing its cooldown to 6-7 seconds.\n\nThanks to how [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b)'s ticks are calculated, you will almost always have all five stacks active for a permanent 25 Health, 10% Weapon Power and 25% Ability Power for far cheaper than [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce), as long as you are spraying teammates or draining opponents.\n\nI have found success taking [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) in scenarios where I am struggling to survive against massive amounts of instakill or near-instakill burst damage, such as Reinhardt's Fire Strike build.",

        "notes": "## **Round 7:**\n\nThis is it, your final form. An endlessly orb-spewing, debuffing, burst healing, high DoT raid boss who just cannot seem to die, together with her entire team lucky (and smart) enough to be in front of her.\n\n### Power:\n\nWe pick [Phantasm](item_21ed9c3d-7a54-438f-9188-f21fd7a7dbfb) here because... well, it's more Biotic Orbs! Dropping a healing Biotic Orb when you Fade can keep you and your teammates topped up and alive, while dropping a damaging one can often deter or even kill opponent Heroes that like to be in close range, like Reaper and Genji.\n\n### Items:\n\nHave a ludicrous amount of money with nothing left to spend on? Consider selling [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b) for [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce).\n\nHaving difficulty surviving against instakill or near-instakill burst damage? Consider selling [Extendrils](item_138e73a2-6915-4ffc-bd89-029a85bf94b8) or [Superflexor](item_580b77b4-0d63-469b-99a8-5372c55dfc1b) for [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8).\n\nUnder any circumstances, do NOT ever sell [Smart Orbs](item_47f5985c-9b63-40d2-938b-63a22154b9be), as tempting as it might be to acquire another Epic item. This deceptively powerful item ensures that you are maximizing every last Biotic Orb that even catches a whiff of a teammate or opponent, especially the additional ones from [Multiball](item_5d0e4135-f4e1-42fb-991a-417643064560).\n\nGood luck, and may the Biotic Orbs fly ever in your favor.",
