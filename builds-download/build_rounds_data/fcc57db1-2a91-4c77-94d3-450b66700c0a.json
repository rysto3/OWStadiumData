        "notes": "One day, I thought to myself, I really love Skiesti's build, but I do also love earning a ton of money - thus this build was born. It leans into healing power a lot to get frequent ults and keep the team alive, but is by no means a healbot build. I frequent over 2k damage boosted most rounds with it, and I'm more often than not one of the richest players on the team! \n\nSo, first round we're going [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb) as I promise you, it nets you the most amount of money from any starting power. You just have to frequently switch your beams between your team, but it really is worth it. We need the money to be powerful fast. And, it also means we get ult a lot faster than without it. \n\nFor the items, the whole build is set on weapon power and a bit of attack speed, so this is what we're going with here as well, and of course armour for survivability.",

We're getting [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) now, so you probably know the drill already. \n\nThis is why we're also going with [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) for our next item, helping us rez more often and in safer positions. I would also sell some rare items we still have so we can afford [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) now, as it also helps keep our team alive. If you already have it, go with [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448) or any other good weapon power / attack speed item. Just make sure to spend your money. \n\nIf you feel like you have enough healing and want to lean more heavily into the rez build, go with more cooldown reduction like [Martian Mender](item_0099632b-4e18-450e-844f-22c40e51bc98) instead.",

        "notes": "So, if the game ever goes this far, you have a TON OF OPTIONS. I'm writing all of them out, which is why there's so many optional items and this text is a bible. But the build is set already, so you can really do whatever floats your boat. Let me explain: \n\nIf you wanna lean more heavily into the rez build that Skiesti did, go for [First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d) as your power. For items, you could go [Martian Mender](item_0099632b-4e18-450e-844f-22c40e51bc98) or even [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) if you want to be more tanky. The ability power is useful for first responder now, so it's not completely useless to build, and more armour and armour restoration is always great. \n\nIf you're still missing healing, you can go with [Triage Unit](item_fec0554c-2685-4b93-822d-bf0020e654b4) here, and build more weapon power / attack speed. I would go with either [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) for the attack speed, which further amplifies our healing, or [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b), as it gives the most raw weapon power. \n\nAnd if you've tasted lots of blood and want to shoot your way out of this game, I'd recommend [Battle Medic](item_ccd0edff-4d57-4ac2-83a7-bab6ff0ffb2f) here. It gives you full stacks instantly if you're in Valk, which you will be after each rez as well, and [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) allows you to barbie blaster them all while still helping your team! In this case, maybe go for [Commander's Clip](item_ff7cad01-2065-4908-a2c1-3bdf1458c7a4) or [Celestial Clip](item_f9251c1f-5d38-4dd3-9365-8accca4b009b) for more ammo outside of Valk, or once again raw weapon power. \n\nLastly, if you just like flying around and feel like you're missing movement in this build, fear not, you could buy [Angelic Acrobatics](item_baad85fc-3da5-43af-ad9d-f17885f59aa5) here for your dream movement without missing out on anything. Pair it with any power honestly, the main build is done, you could even go for [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9) here if you think it's funny. \n\nThat's it! I hope that wasn't too much and you enjoyed my build. Try it and let me know if you like it or if there's any suggestions for improvement! I think it's very versatile and allows for many different playstyles, it just focuses on first and foremost GETTING THE DOLLAR!",
