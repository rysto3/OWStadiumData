Just abuse siphon gloves + hidden blade and maybe lifesteal if needed and you're sqaure. Just remember, no matter how tempting, NO AMBUSHER OPTICS (yet). Just get that shuriken damage as high as you can. After testing I think all out damage is better than speed for the melee build (even though speed affects melee). But if you need get aftermarket firing pin, it's not bad but only get it if your money turns out that way. This total spent amount is also misleading, as long as your hitting like 20% weapon power or more it's fine, just do whatever combination you can afford.",

        "notes": "Now here hashimoto's bane will make the mechanics a bit less forgiving and allow for us to secure more kills with that overlap damage after the rightclick melee. Gloom gauntlet is the only other sustain we'll get for now, you can keep gloves if you want but really just try to get that damage damage damage. If you're riding a high, you can always skip the gauntlet and go for the closer right now, but I'd only do that if I had a lot of confidence because at this point all the character's that actually deal good damage base game will be bullying your hp bar. Also heavy note to why hashimoto's bane comes in now, if you get it at round 3 you simply don't have enough weapon power and the 2 extra shurikens don't do much, so it's important to emphasize getting this now and definitely not sooner. You can try getting it later but I think getting this damage now is most beneficial.",

        "notes": "Now to conclude due to the fact that Genji really only has hidden blade + hashimoto's bane for actually good offensive powers (I already explained why I hate aido strike). We'll really just get a power centering around deflect, do whatever you think you need, I probably gravitate mostly towards deflecto bot because it's defensive and kinda offensive (especially to all the forbidden hitscan characters in this game double dinking you from across the map). But truthfully do what you'd like, if you really like aido strike you can try it here, I've just never had much success with it ever since storing was removed. Spirit of sojiro can get that hashimoto's bane uptime up as well. Forged under fire is great if they are out of distance for deflecto bot, but it goes all in on defense. As for the buys just lap up more and more and more weapon power + whatever else you might need. Gotta delete juno mercy backline? You can get the purple for it. Shred armor? Get that purple. Can't afford a purple? Talon modification module or icy coolant. But honestly I highly recommend  [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb), it's genuinely really good and you could get it over the closer if you'd like but I think the closer is generally better to get first because the flat damage is not ability dependent. You get the point. At this point you're really hard to kill so probably don't get more sustain. Getting that TTK down will save you more than sustain items by this round (most likely).",
