It amps up the value of Valkyrie atleast twice as hard - you heal and DMG boost without the need to compromise; you can freely pistol everybody, which means more dmg, which means more kills, which means more cash, which means ez win.\nIf you dont pick this power early on you essentially have no real ultimate, period.\n\nOther than that you really wanna focus on getting more Weapon Power, Attack Speed and survivability items. Ability power is really useless, dont even bother with it unless you go with Powers that scale with AP (like  [The Whambulance](item_67e91029-d0fc-4c9d-9733-ec7e1cc064a9)), but they are not even good in the first place sooooo... yeah",
