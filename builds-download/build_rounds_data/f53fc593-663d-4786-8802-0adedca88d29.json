Take  [Clone Conjuration](item_6c9f6be1-ab29-4f46-af24-34e4835f9af3), this will spawn a clone close to you wherever you use your swift step. This can be used to either healbot, to distract, or to deal extra damage. The clone inherits all your stats except powers and lasts 5 seconds. It acts as an extra ally and counts towards objectives and other aspects where another player can be counted.\n\nUsing this, we can finally start to dive behind the enemy frontlines, you can soften whoever you pick as a target by trying to chip their health to half or whichever is comfortable to you, then use your swift step preferably behind them or by their side to catch them off-guard, together with your clone you can practically kill them on the spot. \n\nDo note the clone will act in two ways depending on where you decide to tp. If you tp near your team, it will prioritize healing anyone with a slight  reduction in their health, even YOU. So you can make the clone healbot your team or yourself, otherwise, throw kunais towards the enemy. Now if you tp far away from your team, like the enemy backlines for example, the clone will instead target the nearest enemy in its line-of-sight, providing damage. It will switch to healing if you even receive the tiniest bit of damage\n\nThis playstyle is complemented by the next item  [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448). By using swift step, you can get one stack and before that runs out, you can pop suzu for survivability and another stack. You can consistently maintain 2 stacks every time you engage/dive with this method. It also provides much needed Cooldown Reduction to be able to quickly tp back to your team after eliminating an enemy. Basically, the clone will do healing or damage depending on who it is closest to.\n\nIf you cannot afford it, sell  [Farsight Focus Sash](item_103e6d35-a71f-48c7-b7b9-b89efae62242)\n\nYou can replace  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) with  [Icy Coolant](item_8b1c21e9-33e8-49a6-8277-a3a06d55a65f) for faster downtime of your dive.",

Using this, if you decide to tp behind or very close your target, you can literally go up their face, aiming at their head, and click. It is an instant kill considering your weapon stats. It can also bust tanks if you ever get close to them. \n\nWhenever you cast ult, tp behind them to spawn a clone, making sure you're still inside your ult, you can demolish the enemy team together with your buffed clone and hundred bouncing kunais.",
