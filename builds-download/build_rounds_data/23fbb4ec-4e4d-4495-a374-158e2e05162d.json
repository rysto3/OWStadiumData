With the amount of AP you have at this point **swift strike** does a TON of damage, especially with  [Laceration](item_ee831ad3-3921-4aca-a761-c6b93cc7e7fe)   It now does around 125dmg more than base  [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168) and don't forget you can hit multiple people with it meaning at max you're doing 625 with a single **swift strike**. Use it to secure kills on hard to hit targets and generating more ult charge\n\nPlaystyle:\nFull assassin. Make sure to pick your targets carefully. Squishes, enemies with no teammates or not getting care. Simply **deflect**,  [Iaido Strike](item_0b4def91-53c9-4bb7-b706-05aff6e4b168), **swift strike**. Most people don't notice but you also still have pretty crazy kill power on tanks, if a support looks away for a second your combo can do more than half their health making an easy kill for your team.",

Deflecting anything at an enemy will apply their debuffs making the tagged enemy a almost guaranteed kill. Hitting enemies with  [Dragon's Breath](item_32dc8374-7541-46fb-9891-29b7fbe9ed4d) also is a way to debuff a group of enemies for your teammates.

I take  [Hanamura Healing](item_d210417d-1e30-4571-a4f3-cccd1dfc23ca) although its a dumb reason, I personally never hold my **deflect** up and almost always insta cancel unless enemies are far. I have my own weird playstyle, I pretty much only use deflect as if it were a free slash. Although the critical overhealth will likely be wasted the overhealth from **swift strike** helps a lot. Beside that between  [Forged Under Fire](item_b60b1aa3-e69d-4d19-b3d8-43de1cce110c) and  [Spirit of Sojiro](item_273ac0b7-f669-4641-bd77-2826aadd3218) it is basically picking between sustain or mobility respectively. For items it is also up to your play style. You can pick between  [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4),  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) and  [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48). At this stage in the game your ult is a team fight winner straight up so  [Catalytic Crystal](item_3e3f4f77-cdf8-4dda-a5b0-2fb9390aefc4) is a very strong choice here. If your blades aren't that good or your find yourself dying to fast and not able to generate ult enough  [Lumerico Fusion Drive](item_3da81000-333c-460a-a1a2-09441bfda9c8) is a very good choice for survival but truthfully who wants to take that when you can take. . . the third choice. Surprisingly an item from the weapon section.  [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48). This is an amazing item for your ult as well, movement speed + AS which helps blades become overpowered. It also helps with chasing down enemies.
