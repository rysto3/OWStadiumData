        "notes": "threads of fate round 1 every game - this does require you to juggle your beams a bit more but its a very good way of point farming and since you go strong weapon power youre outputting a lot of healing to your team. it allows you to do everything 50% more efficiently it's really great\n\nbasic green weapon power + attack speed. reduced self heal time is good because you're very self reliant and having this kick in for you instead of relying on other support is great\n\nan important note about this is that you don't generate money while you're dead, so you absolutely have to prioritise surviving",

        "notes": "round 5 is easily mercy's most adaptable round in that you have a lot of choices for your power here. i almost always go serenity, but i'll go over the choices.\n\ncrepuscular circle: ABSOLUTELY take this if you didn't in round 3!!\n\nserenity: this is the most consistent in my opinion, and it allows you to self sustain easier and makes you pseudo-tankier in valk with your beams connecting still giving you increased healing even if your team is full health. this i find makes me more self sufficient and makes me rely less on a second healer\n\ntriage unit: it's good for the same reasons it was good on round three, but it's a bit more generically splashable on a build here. it does help with your healing but i find i don't use this well since i don't really like to ga to low health targets and i find it makes me predictable with my movement/makes me not have it up for when it's more necessary for my survival but i think it's still a great one\n\nbattle medic: well... this IS a really good perk but its still only really available while you're in valk or if you're crazy and want to do wild stuff when you're not in valk. it is viable and CAN be absolutely crazy if you can hit your shots. i usually go this if my dps are not doing anything at all like theyre completely terrible OR if the enemy backline is easy to kill (think mercy/ashe/ana etc, easily dived characters)\n\ni don't think there's any wrong choices as far as these three are concerned, just better ones for your situation. (but i would love to see some battle medic mercy clips)\n\nas for items themselves, i like to go either one of eye of the spider or booster jets that i didn't get last round and have the 3 blues i've mentioned before. if you can afford the closer to sell aftermarket firing pin then great! just work around =)\n\nnow adding blessed boosters to your optional powers. if you think you need this to survive more then i recommend it! it's a good one and i find helps more than reduced ga cooldown after ending crouch/jump inputs",
