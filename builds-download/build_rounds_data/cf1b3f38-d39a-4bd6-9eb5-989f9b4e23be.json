        "notes": "Round 1: We're choosing Threads of Fate vs Crepuscular Circle.\nEither of these are perfectly fine choices for the first round. The only difference is with Threads of Fate, you'll be able to heal multiple targets outside of your ult. It's also helpful for when one of your idiots gets walled off or runs out of sight and you lose connection, you can simply connect with another target and they'll get healed. Still, the target you don't have selected that's still being healed will only be healed at 50% of your full power, so at baseline you will be healing your main target 55hp per second, and the secondary target at 27.5hp per second. (heals per second will be shortened to HPS from here on).\n\nHowever, if you're confident in your ability to rapidly switch between targets and keep everyone up, you can pick Crepuscular Circle, allowing for you to heal everyone within line of sight when you ult as well as damage boost them. This allows for you to pull out your sidearm and go DPS Mercy when ulting OR be able to rez and heal at the same time. This will also maximize your money gain if you time your ult right.\n\nI tend to go with Threads of Fate, especially if you have a team that will be spread out for the most part, to avoid the age-old problem of conga-line Mercying after your teammates to your death.\n\nApart from the Power choice, I've chosen the 3 items I usually go with. The 5% weapon power brings your heals per second to about 58HPS from just the baseline of 55, and the additional 5% weapon speed brings it to a total of 60.6HPS. \nREMEMBER: The most important stat boosts for Mercy in Stadium are weapon power and weapon speed. Power increases how much you heal, speed increases how fast the heals are applied. However, for mathematical simplicity, I will convert all heals to a per second rate.",

        "notes": "Round 2: It's time to begin building your HPS. For this, I usually go with Amari's Antidote OR Caduceus Ex, depending on the situation.\n\nFor the most part, Amari's Antidote is the correct choice to get as many HPS as possible. With the base 15% weapon power increase, that will bring Mercy's HPS to about 63.25 per second. When your healing target is below 50% hp, her HPS increases further for a 30% total increase to 71.5 per second.\n\nOtherwise, if you're having trouble reaching your teammates because they keep running away from the doctor like a child (Or you didnt earn 11k for Amari's Antidote), choose Caduceus Ex. This extends your beam length a lot and will allow you to heal from much further, allowing for better positioning (Cover is a Mercy's best friend!)\n\nIf you didn't make enough money for either item, wtf were you doing? I guess pick some blue items to get more heals.",

When your target falls below 50% heals, your HPS goes up to 77 a second.\n\nApart from those 2 items, I've selected some optional Items if you have more cash to spend. Remember, maximizing weapon power and weapon speed is your best bet to outheal any damage. Wasting money and slots on survivability is fine if you need it, but a good Mercy will have the positioning, awareness, and movement to survive anything, even without items to buff those things. To help improve your movement as Mercy, try some Mercy Parkour sets!",

        "notes": "Round 5: I've chosen Serenity OR Distortion once again. Usually, by round 5 the enemy team has realize that they need to kill you to win, so I pick Serenity. This means when you heal you get healed more with Sympathetic Healing, and you still get healed even when your target(s) are full health, meaning you're Practically always self healing.\n\nIf the enemy hasn't realized or learned to target you, Distortion is a great choice for you to damage boost your teammates so they can heal themselves. Make them work for it.\n\nItem wise, here is your time to add your own flair. I usually pick a combination that gives me high Weapon Speed and Power, just to ensure I heal even more every second. You can mix and match from my optional items below, but next Round I will have the exact items I tend to have by then",

        "notes": "Round 7: I usually just get Distortion since that's the one I tend to buy last, but you can always choose another Power if you prefer. Item-wise, I've already explained to get as much weapon power and speed as possible, so splurge on that!\n\nI've highlighted and said to buy Eye of the Spider, the 14,000 point item because it gives the most weapon power for 1 slot, and does more damage to low HP targets, allowing you to help clean up when you ult. The perfect balance between healing and DPS Mercy.\n\nAdvanced Nanobiotics gives a small boost of weapon power and 10% speed after you heal (so basically al the time as Mercy).\n\nIn Total with these stats. 55HPS base Mercy + 55% weapon power= 85.25HPS. With the weapon speed added (a total of 30% faster weapon speed with the Advanced NanoBiotics) that's 111HPS (about). When your target is half health or lower, it increases to about 121.5HPS. Neat.\n\nI also have some Optional Items for you to pick from. The Three-Tap Tommy Gun is an excellent choice for healers who realize they need to do DPS in order to win, but for Mercy it's soley for use during her ult, doing massive damage with her lil tic tac gun. The idea would be to Guardian Angel, shoot 3 times, fly, shoot, fly, shoot. Otherwise, more heals and speed is always an option!\n\nGood Luck, remember situational awareness, positioning, movement, and allow the idiots on your team to die if they're being dumb (they will be). Prioritize your best teammate (highest points on ur team) and your other healer. PLEASE heal your other healer. PLEASE",
