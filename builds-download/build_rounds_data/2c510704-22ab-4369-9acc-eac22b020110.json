        "notes": "## Second power spike\n\nFor rounds 5 and 6, you'll be basically unstoppable for these two rounds, once you build armor and ult (You'll need to play a lot more conservatively until then). Here, I'll discuss general strategy and how to play your role in the game, so treat this page as a main guide and adaptations, especially as you climb.\n\n---\n\n## GENERAL STRATEGY (for higher elo)\n\nWithout insane damage like the rest of stadium players, you'll need to adapt your playstyle to take advantage of your survivability. Think of your role as a Captain America that bullies the other tank: your value is usually indirect and relies on your inability to die until players deprioritize you (which is the right play), which is when you should go for kills. The key to this build is [Vanadium Injection](item_57953fbc-11ff-4e92-9928-fc59b7be668f): as long as you have your ult, you can easily win any 1v1 in the game. In lower elo, your health pool lets you outsustain enemy damage and lets you survive burst combos in higher elo. Your biggest weakness is lack of burst: if a support is focusing a player you won't be able to kill them.\n\nIn lower elos, you literally 1v5 and win. Once you climb, your strategy needs to change: opponents improve mechanics and builds, and you'll need to improve in strategy\n\n---\n\n## UNDERSTANDING YOUR VALUE\n\n* Your thinking should be like a Cap player: its very easy to not die if you play safe enough, but you'll need to push those limits to extract value.\n* Once players improve, your survivability is no longer enough to sustain 1v3, 1v4s, 1v5s, etc. Instead, it lets you trade efficiently (20\u201340% DR means more healing for your supports), survive oncoming pressure, and waste your opponent's burst combos.\n* If multiple players chase you and you survive, even if you used all your cooldowns that's a good trade. Use wall and coulder to send a message: *running me down is a waste of time*, this forces the opponent to respect your angles and positioning. If you're playing too aggressively or standing out in the open, this whole contract falls apart. You cannot be first death on this build.\n* Left click slow is brutal (try playing the other side of this matchup). The more consistently you can apply this effect, the harder it is for your opponents to push. If you're piercing the tank and another player that's very good value, even if there's no kill. You punish clumped up team compositions.\n* You have insane 1v1 potential with your healthpool. As fights devolve, supports are under pressure and you'll be the only one tanky enough to find isolated targets and kill them. Your TTK is reasonable if they're not being healed, and you can effectively contest offangles using your healthpool.\n* Walls: like regular Mei, walls are a huge portion of your value. Remember that Vanadium gives a 10% cooldown reduction. This is a deep part of Mei's kit, so I won't go into too much detail, but split teams, limit positioning, peel, block movement etc.\n\n---\n\n## IMPROVING SURVIVABILITY\n\nAs you climb, players will be getting better at mechanics and positioning. Since your primary fire doesn't need too much aim, you'll need to get better at other areas to compensate. Specifically:\n\n* Corner peeking, greedy chokepoints & utilizing range. Remember you have a 16m range: the more you're able to minmax this, the longer you'll live.\n* A/D strafing: in a soldier vs soldier matchup, strafing aggressively worsens your opponent's aim, but also your own. When you're fighting hitscans, everything changes: the better you strafe, the longer you'll live. Remember that vanadium gives you a 10% move speed buff - I can confidently tell you that against talented hitscans you can make them miss their shots, but you need to put mental effort into it.\n* Cooldown management: generally, use early walls to prevent some burst damage. You'll need to min/max coulder for when your armor runs out (**YOU CAN BE HEALED IN IT**), and by the time you exit you'll have another wall if you still need that. Remember to use your armor health as a resource.\n* Respect burst: you can survive a maxed soldier rocket, queen axe (though try to avoid this), juno rocket, getting slept etc. You'll have \\~50% health left, put that on cooldown, and your supports can build some ult charge. If multiple enemies burst you at once, you're dead.\n* Respect melee Reinhardt (and cassidy): abuse the 16m range, unless (Cassidy) isn't getting pocketed (you can win the 1v1 remember).\n\n---\n\n## PLAYING AGAINST BURST HEROES\n\nThey tend to spec into one particular combo but lack in other stats. You can survive their combo but you need to respect it, and remember that they're typically weak without the cooldown.\n\n* **AP soldier**: if you're pressuring him, he'll likely rocket you. If you're both alone you can actually finish him off afterwards (using coulder to heal). The key to this matchup is wall: it lets your supports to heal you to full, after which you can continue pressuring him while rocket is on cooldown. Obviously, cryo if you need to but that's a bad trade imo.\n* **AP queen**: you need to deny Axe using Primary slow, it has an animation so you can reliably wall/coulder it. If you do get hit, probably pop coulder to prevent healing, as it does do a lot. If you get knifed, be prepared to cancel their pull/axe combo using wall or coulder.\n* **Freja**: easy matchup imo. She relies on 1-2 shotting squishies and overall DPS isn't that high. They need to burn a lot of cooldowns to spam bolts on you, and coulder can negate all that.\n* **Juno**: you can actually survive several rounds of rockets, but this isn't ideal. Instead, take cover and pressure her: if she's forced to respect your primary or solo torpedo you that's a good trade. Blocking torpedoes with Wall is very consistent and ruins a Juno's day. \n* **Ana**: if they're going sleep build, you need to respect this. Don't expect to kill her while it's available, but know that you can survive being slept and she's pretty useless without it.\n* **Cassidy**: if their team is supporting them, you need to play range (16m). His right click + roll combo can kill you from close range if he hits all the shots, but unlike other DPS he doesn't have a bailout ability, so longer fights where you hold primary are good for you. Know that you still win the 1v1, with proper coulder timing.\n\n---\n\n## TANK MATCHUPS\n\nThe most important thing to consider here is what your own tank needs in the tank 1v1. This is too complex to cover in entirety but you'll need to use your assets to provide as much value as possible. Some examples:\n\n* **(Your) Sigma vs Queen**: Your tank needs you to help him survive the Queen's axe combo. Be prepared to instantly wall off a shout, wall off the axe, or even tank the hit and coulder.\n* **(Your) Reinhardt vs (most tanks)**: they will die if the enemy DPS focus fire on him. You need to stand behind shield and poke them with primary, and be prepared to run it down if he charges.\n* **(Most tanks) vs Fortify Orisa**: walling her off won't kill her and is a bad trade. Instead, line up primary to clip her while focusing on the DPS/supports.\n* **AP Queen vs (most tanks)**: if you can wall someone off and she gets her axe hit that's huge. You can start looking for it as soon as you hear the shout.\n\nIn general it's too complicated to document here, but remember your assets in this matchup:\n\n* Primary fire slow\n* Primary fire pierce\n* Wall\n* Disruption coulders (during pushes)\n* Contesting with coulder/wall\n* Tanking burst damage, if need be\n\n---\n\n## PUNISHING SQUISHIES\n\nAs fights devolve, supports will have more and more tasks to tend to, and that's when you can go for plays. Typical targets are enemy supports, then Ashe (if they're alone), and divers recovering from dives. Remember your biggest weakness: if someone is being pocketed, you can't burst them. \n\nHere are the situations to go in and get a pick:\n\n* You're playing normally, pressuring a squishy using Primary slow, and the enemy support just doesn't peel and heal.\n* Enemy team is pushing in (catch a lagging support)\n* Enemy tank is under pressure\n* You managed to isolate a support or flanking DPS with wall\n* Messy teamfights in general\n\n---\n\n## OTHER DPS MATCHUPS\n\n* **Ashe**: honestly kinda free unless she plays it right. Even your right clicks are very threatening, she's constantly a liability, and dynamite does nothing. Her only asset is coach gun, but you have icicles for that.\n* **Genji**: You can peel for your team, I prefer marking them when they're on an off angle and punishing them when they need to get out.\n* **Reaper**: since its a shotgun, your armor and items give you insane DR. If he builds armor pen, you do need to respect his damage and pop cooldowns for it. If he doesn't, it's actually just free.\n* **Junkrat**: I haven't played the new season that much yet, but from what I can tell you just need to play a bit more off angly, away from tank. Right click is amazing, and don't contest him in small rooms.",

You can still dive backline, just do it in middle of fights. Swap  [Martian Mender](item_0099632b-4e18-450e-844f-22c40e51bc98) if you're not getting healed, or  [Divine Intervention](item_b5148b7f-8529-4b1b-a90c-5d7cf13f8f0c) for  [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016) if they're running Juno/burst builds. Do not swap  [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09) even if you're maxed out on credits.",
