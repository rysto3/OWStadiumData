        "notes": "Threads of fate is almost always going to be what you want to take first round, its uptime is easily the best out of any of the powers as you can simply keep flicking your beam between targets, it also has double use as you can either damage boost or heal two targets its especially good when damage boosting two targets who are focusing one person. Its also great to get more money for later rounds \n\nAs for items you want weapon power to strengthen your heals , Weapon speed to increase your heals and also first aid kit which synergises with mercy quite well with how much she can dart about with GA",

        "notes": "Crepuscular circle is OP, at first I simply saw it as something you'd take if you were running a damage mercy build and yes its great for that but its also just good in general. For starters you can res without beam downtime meaning your team are more likely to survive without your constant attention but also you don't have to choose between healing and damage boost during valk like you normally would because both are applied meanwhile you can do some damage of your own.\nAlso ult charge is really fast in stadium so don't worry about its downtime too much. \nAs for items its personally a choice between Amaris antidote and chain evoker and the choice is pretty simple as it comes down to what you need more. If your finding you need more healing particularly if your other support has gone a more damage oriented build then Amaris is great for keeping your team alive and stable. Meanwhile Chain evoker will be great if your getting lots of opportunities for damage boost and if your other support can cover healing comfortably. If you took one of them last round feel free to just take the other this round",

If you have enough money feel free to take resurrection rangefinder to mostly fix that issue or even angelic acrobatics which simply pairs nice with the item.",

If you find your getting lots of value from damage boost then I like to take distortion. and If your the one whos in need of more heals then serenity is a great choice. I personally usually take distortion as its great for pushing blue beam while also keeping your team topped up. \nThis is also the round where you'll be wanting to get rid of those green perks for something more useful. \nIf you didnt take blessed boosters last round then id suggest you pick it up here as its really useful but also really fun with how much you can dart about. If you have enough money then resurrection rangefinder pairs with it pretty nice as blessed boosters on its own can mess up resses sometimes.",

If you need more healing and haven't taken it already then triage unit is great. If your the one who's always getting focused which might happen especially in a round this late then serenity is a great pick up. Both glass extra full and protective beam are great if you can consistently keep your teammates hp high so it comes down to preference. I personally like to take Protective beam if I can afford to as the survivability It can bring to the team is really good especially during valk which hopefully you'll be getting quite a lot in round 7. \nAs for your final item I personally love to take eye of the spider the weapon power it grants can be clutch for both heals and damage and the ability to do more damage to low targerts can be really strong in valk team fights and once again you should be getting valk a lot in round 7. If your not as confidant with the pistol then caduceus Ex is also great especially if your often playing further away from your team for your own safety.",
