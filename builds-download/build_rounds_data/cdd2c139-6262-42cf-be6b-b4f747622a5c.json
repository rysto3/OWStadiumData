This is going to become your main form of sustain now and it can be helpful to let your allies know at this point that they can stack more lifesteal to capitalize off damage boost. \n\nThis is very good on teams that already have a life steal mechanic or self heal like Queen, Reaper, Soldier, Moira, or Lucio. This is also very good on teams with the gimmicky Reinhardt hammer build since you can boost his attack and he will likely heal himself more than you would with the primary beam.\n\nA benefit of these two powers is that you generate a lot of cash from using damage boost, more than you would from only healbotting. I'm unsure if it's possible for Mercy to get the most cash out of anyone in a lobby, but it prevents those games where you're working your tail off and still at the lowest cash in the match.\n\nAt this point, you have some options of how to build your survivability. I really enjoy[Aerodynamic Feathers](item_03d95229-b91d-48c0-b1e3-c8075b678ef0). This also takes effect during Valkyrie and can give you an insane amount of maneuverability around the map without necessarily needing to use Guardian Angel to get around. However, if you're being too pressured by hitscan to stay in the air for long periods of time, [Vital-E-Tee](item_b92e6f1d-3aac-4eec-b027-00c8e1529016)and [Crusader Hydraulics](item_b64cee07-ca32-405d-987e-868b415bbc09)are indispensable against hitscans.\n\nIf you somehow have overflowing cash at this point, just fill your empty slots with [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0),  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf), and the  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6).",

        "notes": "This is another pivotal point where you may want to go all in on weapon power or branch out into resurrect. If you're not really needing to resurrect as much and your tank and DPS are doing well, you can absolutely stick with weapon power to great success. However, if it's not extremely one-sided, having a resurrect ability in your back pocket to turn the tide of a fight back in your favor is also very, very good. It pushes Mercy's design to the absolute pinnacle of her utility.\n\nIf you're going all in on weapon power, [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7)is your best choice. You can also add the rare perk  [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a)\n\nThis is about $25500 cash, which you should be over by round 4 with the damage boost build. Again, you can fill your leftover spots with the Vital-E-Tee and Crusader Hydraulics for survival, Aerodynamic Feathers for maneuverability, or common weapon power or attack speed perks.\n\nIf you're branching out to include resurrect, [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f)is amazing. It increases the basic range for resurrect from 5 meters to 8.75 meters, allowing you to resurrect from safety much more often. The nice part about branching into resurrect is that you really only need to add Rez Rangefinder to get a lot of power into it. Chain Evoker and Rez Rangefinder are only $20000 cash so you can, again, fill your leftover spots with the Vital-E-Tee and Crusader Hydraulics for survival, Aerodynamic Feathers for maneuverability, or common weapon power or attack speed perks.",

        "notes": "By this point in the match, you're likely to have enough cash to have most perks you want-slash-need for a build (or the game has already ended!(and you clearly won with this build duh)) \n\nThe most important thing at this point is to try and fine-tune your build to what your team needs. If you need more sustain, focusing on weapon power to get your healing up will be helpful. Damage Boost is still your focus here, but having both damage boost and high healing on your primary beam will allow you to quickly top up those who cannot easily engage from range like Genji, Reaper, Queen, Reinhardt, Zarya, D.Va, and Moira.\n\nIf you are unfettered from the foul shackles of an enemy hitscan, you may fly wild and free across the battlefield like a beautiful butterfly and do basically whatever you want. You go girl, you resurrect that Reinhardt who inted into the enemy backline for free. No one is going to stop you or notice that you did it, honestly.\n\nNEW POWER TIME\n\nYou have a few options here and it's really your call. p [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb),  [First Responder](item_30a5c70f-e0b5-489a-96ae-900f34c3823d), or  [Renaissance](item_a460f234-6434-4d47-99f9-d4a0b15cd591) are the move. If you're all in on weapon power and your team is doing well, Crepuscular Circle allows YOU to get in on the action during Valkyrie. Pull that glock out, sis, let them have it.\n\nIf you're also focusing on weapon power but maybe you don't have as much survivability or get hard focused, First Responder is likely a guarantee you will survive long enough to escape following your rez. \n\nIf you're not really being looked at or have Rez Rangefinder already, you're probably going to want to grab Renaissance, which gives you instant mobility and chain beams to apply pressure with damage boost after you cast rez.\n\nAs far as perks, same stuff we've talked about all along. At this point, the core of your build likely won't change much until the match ends... depending on what your team needs. I tossed some alternate perks into optional that can be some good alternatives if you need to shore up in one area.",

Your best powers at this point are going to be between the two you didn't choose in round 5: Crepuscular Circle, Renaissance, or First Responder.\n\nAgain, focus on pushing that damage boost as often as you can. Any time you're just healing, you're losing out on damage and lifesteal your allies could be doing.\n\nYou got this! I believe in you :)",
