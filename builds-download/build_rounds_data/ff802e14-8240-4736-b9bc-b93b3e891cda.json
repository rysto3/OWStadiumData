        "notes": "This is what I start with every stadium match. It has additional 7 HPS and a little bit of survivability. \n\n***Threads of Fate:***\nIn my opinion, if you don\u2019t start with Threads of Fate, you start off wrong. This power is the best one hands down. You are immediately 50% more effective with both damage boost and healing for the first two rounds and that is more than ANY other power or item can give you.\n\n***Compensator:***\n5% Weapon Power, this is the best 1k item you can get.\n\n***Weapon Grease:***\n5% Attack Speed, this is the second best 1k item you can get.\n\n***First Aid Kit:***\n25 Shields + 33% time reduction on your self healing. This gives you an extra 25 regenerating shield and faster recovery for your support passive  when you cannot heal with Sympathetic Recovery.\n\n\nI DO NOT Recommend:\n\n\nX ***Armored Vest*** (1,500) - Despite it being armor rather than shields, it does not have the perk that First Aid does with the shorter heal reduction. I will always take First Aid  Armored Vest.\n\nX ***Running Shoes*** (1,000) - This item is useless on spawn as you have GA to assist you, its only use is on respawns and returning you faster to your team. Its only value hinges on you dying. Don\u2019t get it.\n\nX ***Winning Attitude*** (1,000) - This item\u2019s value hinges on you dying. It\u2019s not worth the ultimate charge.",

        "notes": "Round Five and Six:\n\nThis is usually the point where I\u2019ve built up my two core healing items and then I decide exactly which version of the Healbae build I\u2019m going for based on my performance.\n\n\nCore Build:\n\n\n***Amari\u2019s Antidote*** (11,000) - The lifesaver and core of your build. Get it.\n\n***Booster Jets*** (11,000) - The best Attack Speed Item you can buy. Get it.\n\n***Eye of the Spider*** (14,500) - A big stat stick. Get it.\n\n***Chain Evoker*** (10,000) - Helps with survivability and buffs blue beam. A Mercy must-have.\n\n\nOption 1: Help - I\u2019m Getting DESTROYED!\n\n*(This build offers strong heals (and in return, strong self heals) whilst giving you some additional movement and protection against those nefarious 2-shotting Genjis. If you\u2019re getting hard targeted, are still learning how to position, or are just having an off day, this can help.)*\n\n\nI\u2019m Getting Wrecked Items:\n\n***Blessed Boosters*** (9,000) - Take this to try and escape and position more unpredictably.\n\n***Overdrive Core*** (10,000) - You will constantly be healing yourself so the real danger for you is getting one/two shot. Overdrive Core will help with that and still gives you some Weapon Power.\n\n\n\nOption 2: I\u2019m an Average Player\n\n*(This build is for those games where you want the raw healing power, and just a little bit of that additional security. This offers a lot of healing, but less survivability. You are more reliant on positioning and ensuring that you never leave your safety with Caduceus Ex, but that\u2019s okay, because that\u2019s all you really need.)*\n\nAverage Comfy Items:\n\n***Hardlight Accelerator*** (11,000) - Adds a new multiplier to your healing. (70 HPS) Get it.\n\n***Caduceus Ex*** (10,000) - Helps you heal people from farther away without abandoning cover. This helps with tanks and flankers who love to dive the enemy team.\n\n\nOption 3: I am untouchable.\n\n*(Nothing makes me happier than Glass Cannon Mercy, big damage, big heals, and in return, enormous damage boost. I have reached insane healing numbers with this build and nothing makes me happier than healing a 1000 hp reinhardt to full in three seconds. This build offers no safety or protection and isn\u2019t feasible in all games, though this build should always be the goal to try and reach.)*\n\nGlass Cannon Items\n\n***Hardlight Accelerator*** (11,000) - Adds a new multiplier to your healing. (70 HPS) Get it.\n\n***The Closer*** (14,500) - Buy this if you can afford it, it\u2019s the best stack stick.\n\n***Advanced Nanobiotics*** (4,500) - This offers the same amount of HPS as The Closer does, but you don\u2019t get the additional Critical Damage for Valkyrie.\n\n***Codebreaker*** (9,000) - I buy this item for one reason, and one reason alone - Orisa.\n\n\n\nI DO NOT Recommend:\n\nX ***Angelic Acrobats*** (10,000) - Blessed Boosters is a better item with additional health and better mobility. I\u2019d take it over Angelic acrobats any day.\n\nX ***Cushioned Padding*** (3,750) - Maybe when Brigitte gets added we\u2019ll need to consider this, but for now you should not be getting hit by Ana Sleep or Nades and that is the only real reason to take this.\n\nX ***Vanadium Injection*** (10,000) - You\u2019re only getting 50 HP from this item because you should be using Valkyrie on Cooldown. Please stop taking this item, I don\u2019t know why I see this used so much.",

        "notes": "What power should I take?\n\n**Serenity**\n\tThe one thing that stinks about being the team healer is that no one saves you (especially if you\u2019re the first one to get dove)! Luckily, your self healing will go pretty nuts with this and you\u2019ll be just fine. If you\u2019re too scared to pick up the barbie blaster, definitely take this instead.\n\n**Battle Medic**\n\tIf you have any sort of aim, take this power. You will be an absolute monster when you go into Valkyrie with full stacks. 60% Attack Speed + 60% Weapon Power - you can absolutely murder an entire team if your aim is on point.\n\n\nI DO NOT Recommend:\nX Glass Extra Full - This power is CURRENTLY BUGGED (as of this update) and the additional healing it gives is usually not worth it. For all my girls who are terrified of the barbie blaster, pick something else!\n\n\nYou should have your full build by now.\n\n\nA Closing Word\nThis is an alternative to the tank/rez/valkyrie build, because I don\u2019t believe all that extra protection is necessary and prefer to use a riskier, more powerful playstyle. If you feel the same, I hope this build serves you well. \n\nA lot of this math was figured out with the use of the Advanced Stadium Workshop as it supplies hps and dps numbers. (Code F4728) Big thanks to Luciomain for making it. \n\nGive it a try and see what suits your playstyle best. Personally, I go with Glass Cannon Healbae and it\u2019s been incredibly effective for me. That said, finding what works takes some experimenting. Different builds come with different levels of risk, so test a few out and see what feels right. \n\nWith practice and some personal tweaks, you\u2019ll find your groove. I look forward to seeing you in the stadium!\n\nA_Lords_Rose",
