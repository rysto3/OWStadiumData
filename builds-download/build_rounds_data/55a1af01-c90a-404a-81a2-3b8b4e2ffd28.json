        "notes": "Pairing Crepuscular Circle with a bit of attack speed + weapon power first round will allow you a good opportunity to help your team implement extra damage and pressure during important moments. \n\nI will say picking this power first round is best paired with good movement. Obviously you're spending the majority of the time in match building your ult while you heal and damage boost your teammates. I'd only pull out the blaster if you notice someone is low, but spend the majority of your time focusing on your team and keeping yourself alive. \n\nWhen you get your ult pair it with a teammates ult to get kills or pop it when multiple people are low and get to shooting. \n\nRinse and Repeat",

Then I would add in Mid-Air mobilizer to get you an extra boost while you're using your blaster during your ult. Grab a mix of other rare weapon items, for round 2 it's really about preference. I tend to go Aftermarket Firing pin and if I have the money I'll add in Icy Coolant and Talon Modification Module.  \n\nAt round 2 you most likely won't have enough to have everything, but if you do good job!",

Our third power is The Whambulance and this is going to help you implement extra healing in those dire times when someone is low. \n\nWe are going to keep our two epics and sell all our rares. Now go to ability and choose Long Distance Wings, Custom Stock, Junker Whatchamajig, and if you can afford it Nano Cola. If you can't afford Nano Cola, but have enough for Power Playbook in common ability grab that one as well. \n\nThe reason we are beefing up her AP is so she gives more of that burst healing with The Whambulance whenever she guardian angels to a teammate.",

Fill the extra space with more AP! \n\nIf you're wanting to build ult charge more often in the eariler rounds then definitely buy Catalytic Crystal with Junker Whatchamajig and Chain Evoker as soon as you're able! \n\nI hope you enjoy and have fun!",
