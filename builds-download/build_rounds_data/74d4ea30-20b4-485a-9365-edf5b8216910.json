These budget picks give you a little of everything: extra healing power, faster Fade cooldowns, and some life steal to stay alive early. Focus on healing first, with damage as a bonus \u2014 your job is to keep your team standing, not to frag. Fade out when things get rough and be ready to top everyone off once the dust settles.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: If you\u2019re comfortable on Moira, lean into her sustain game. Prioritize survivability, stay near teammates, and keep those orbs flowing.",

Smart Orbs + Compensator still go crazy with Optimal Overflow.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 This round is about pressure healing. You want to stick to your team like a ghost \u2014 heal one, move on, repeat.

        "notes": "\ud83d\udd27 Round 5 \u2013 Utility Spike\nPower: Deconstruction\n\nEnemies hit by Biotic Grasp take increased damage from allies for a short time.\n\nThis is where Wraith Nurse shifts from pure sustain into subtle carry support. Deconstruction turns your damage into a debuff tool \u2014 every enemy you touch gets marked for deletion. Combined with Precarious Potency and Optimal Overflow, this rounds out your support style:\n\ud83e\ude78 heal constantly, regen passively, and quietly help melt the enemy team.\n\nSuggested Items (based on your powers):\n\n\ud83e\uddea Amari\u2019s Antidote\nAdds healing boost when allies are at low health \u2014 this stacks beautifully with Precarious Potency, giving your clutch saves extra punch when it matters most.\n\n\ud83d\udd07 El-Sa\u2019ka Suppressor\nGrants damage reduction to allies you heal \u2014 amazing synergy with Precarious Potency, since those effects now come bundled with protection. This one makes you feel like Ana and Moira had a baby.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa Superflexor\nAdds damage and armor after using an ability \u2014 pairs great with Fade (for Voidhoppers value) or launching an orb, reinforcing Moira's tanky side while helping you brawl just a bit harder.\n\n\ud83d\udd01 Alternative Energy\nStill useful if you find yourself drained often \u2014 keeps your orbs and Grasp flowing nonstop.\n\n\ud83e\udd64 Nano Cola\nA straight Ability Power boost that enhances all your healing, damage, and orb output. No explanation needed \u2014 still a top-tier grab.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Multi-Tool\nBonus stats across the board, and a reliable pick if you're not sure what to grab. It\u2019s solid value that always works.\n\n\ud83e\udd8a Mark of Kitsune\nTotally still viable \u2014 especially if you\u2019re leaning into the utility/damage buff side of this build. More crits from allies = more value from your Deconstruction tags.\n\n\ud83d\udcac At this point, your build is adaptable and powerful. Use this round to either round out your sustain or boost your team\u2019s offensive output. You\u2019re not just healing \u2014 you\u2019re controlling the flow of fights.",
