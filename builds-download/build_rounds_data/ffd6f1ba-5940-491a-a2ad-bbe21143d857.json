To get the most out of it, you should be constantly poking enemies and shooting shields.\n- If that aggressive, damage-focused style fits you, take Sonic Boom. If you prefer focusing purely on survival and positioning, the reliable burst from  [Crowd Pleaser](item_ae569e40-3194-4681-b1da-c664d0fa982c)  will feel more effective.\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Fundamentals & Mindset\n\n- Good positioning and smart ability use matter more than stacking AP.\n- Survivability upgrades have the biggest impact\u2014outhealing comes from staying alive and using abilities well.\n- Stay alert for flankers (e.g., Genji, Reaper): ping and boop them away if they dive, but don\u2019t overextend.\n- **Attitude is everything:** The biggest difference-maker is sticking to your fundamentals even when tilted. Don\u2019t throw or give up when things go wrong\u2014higher-ranked players always play to win, no matter the situation. Keep your energy up and focus on your own gameplay, not what others are doing.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Map Knowledge & Positioning\n\n- Take time to study each Stadium map to learn the best angles for healing, cover, and escape routes.\n- Knowing where to position yourself lets you maximize Crossfade value, stay safe from enemy focus, and quickly rotate to support teammates.\n- Look for spots that let you heal multiple allies while staying near walls or cover for fast escapes and boop plays.\n- Use the custom workshop code [YV9KG](https://workshop.codes/YV9KG) to freely explore Stadium maps, practice movement, and find the best healing and escape routes.\n- Mastering map angles is just as important as mechanics\u2014great positioning turns good healing into game-winning impact.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfa5 Standard Lucio Gameplay: Positioning & Team Impact\n\nThis clip shows classic Lucio play\u2014constantly shifting between supporting the frontline and peeling for teammates under threat. Key fundamentals on display:\n\n- Proactively peels for Ashe by shutting down a Genji flank, then quickly rotates back to the tank.\n- Helps Junker Queen pressure the enemy frontline and joins her in a coordinated dive on the enemy backline.\n- Demonstrates Lucio\u2019s value in always moving to where he\u2019s needed most\u2014applying pressure, protecting teammates, and enabling plays.\n\n[YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/embed/e-W2-cWDUis)\n\n**Key takeaway:**  \nLucio doesn\u2019t need to be flying around the map at all times; smart positioning and timely rotations are what make him truly effective.",

Pairing it with Speed Boost for a fast, decisive engage can break enemy lines and win objectives, especially when both teams are poking from cover. Adapt your ult usage to the situation for maximum impact.",
