        "notes": "Round 1: We're choosing Threads of Fate vs Crepuscular Circle.\nEither of these are perfectly fine choices for the first round. The only difference is with Threads of Fate, you'll be able to heal multiple targets outside of your ult. It's also helpful for when one of your idiots gets walled off or runs out of sight and you lose connection, you can simply connect with another target and they'll get healed. Still, the target you don't have selected that's still being healed will only be healed at 50% of your full power, so at baseline you will be healing your main target 55hp per second, and the secondary target at 27.5hp per second. (heals per second will be shortened to HPS from here on).\n\nHowever, if you're confident in your ability to rapidly switch between targets and keep everyone up, you can pick Crepuscular Circle, allowing for you to heal everyone within line of sight when you ult as well as damage boost them. This allows for you to pull out your sidearm and go DPS Mercy when ulting OR be able to rez and heal at the same time. This will also maximize your money gain if you time your ult right.\n\nI tend to go with Threads of Fate, especially if you have a team that will be spread out for the most part, to avoid the age-old problem of conga-line Mercying after your teammates to your death.\n\nApart from the Power choice, I've chosen the 3 items I usually go with. The 5% weapon power brings your heals per second to about 58HPS from just the baseline of 55, and the additional 5% weapon speed brings it to a total of 60.6HPS. \nREMEMBER: The most important stat boosts for Mercy in Stadium are weapon power and weapon speed. Power increases how much you heal, speed increases how fast the heals are applied. However, for mathematical simplicity, I will convert all heals to a per second rate.\n\nEdit: I've been asked how I utilize Threads of Fate to its full potential, so I'm going to attempt to explain to the best of my ability. Essentially, Threads of Fate allows you to heal 2 targets at once, but the secondary target that you switch away from is only held for 3 seconds, and at 50% potential of your main beam. So, what I do, is when I'm close to healing someone to full HP, I switch to another target that NEEDS to be healed, such as someone on critical HP, OR whoever needs topping up. Another way is to target someone quickly, to get your beam going while they're about to be out of line of sight, and switch to someone else closer, just so you're healing while they're walzing off to nowhere. I also do this to damage boost the TWO highest damage dealers on the team. I snap to the second highest, and quickly switch to the main highest, and back and forth, because, remember, the beam only connects to your former target for 3 seconds until stopping.",

        "notes": "Round 2: It's time to begin building your HPS. For this, I usually go with Amari's Antidote OR Caduceus Ex, depending on the situation.\n\nFor the most part, Amari's Antidote is the correct choice to get as many HPS as possible. With the base 15% weapon power increase, that will bring Mercy's HPS to about 63.25 per second. When your healing target is below 50% hp, her HPS increases further for a 30% total increase to 71.5 per second.\n\nOtherwise, if you're having trouble reaching your teammates because they keep running away from the doctor like a child (Or you didnt earn 11k for Amari's Antidote), choose Caduceus Ex. This extends your beam length a lot and will allow you to heal from much further, allowing for better positioning (Cover is a Mercy's best friend!)\n\nIf you didn't make enough money for either item, wtf were you doing? I guess pick some blue items to get more heals.\n\nEDIT: These days, my team is often going off into the distance and the enemy teams have been targeting me much earlier. I find I survive most when I use Caduceus Ex, having slightly less heals in favor of survivability. Otherwise, everything I wrote earlier is still true, I'm just switching which item I get first, depending on the situation. Remember, even though we have slightly less heals with Caduceus Ex, your heals drop to 0 no matter what if you're dead, so it's best to stay alive!",

This maximizes both your healing potential and your ability to take cover.\n\nWith both items, it brings Mercy's HPS to 68.75HPS when your target is more than half health. When it drops below 50%, her healing increases to 77HPS.\n\nIf you have extra cash, you can get another purple item, my suggestion is Chain Evoker to improve your damage boost and ult building. \nOR get some blue items. \nI like to combine Advanced Nanobiotics and Mid-Air Mobilizer. These, together, increases your weapon power and speed. IF you were to get both items, it brings Mercy's base healing to 74.25HPS with just the weapon power. When considering the weapon speed as well, it brings it to 89.1, and that's not considering the extra healing when your target is below half health. \n\nNow, with the blue items, one item only gives you the weapon speed boost after you heal, which shouldn't be an issue as Mercy. The other, Mid-Air Mobilizer, only gives you extra weapon power and speed when in the air, which once again, if you're a good Mercy who has mastered her movement, you should **easily** be able to stay in the air constantly without being eliminated.",

        "notes": "Round 5: I've chosen Serenity OR Distortion once again. Usually, by round 5 the enemy team has realize that they need to kill you to win, so I pick Serenity. This means when you heal you get healed more with Sympathetic Healing, and you still get healed even when your target(s) are full health, meaning you're Practically always self healing.\n\nIf the enemy hasn't realized or learned to target you, Distortion is a great choice for you to damage boost your teammates so they can heal themselves. Make them work for it.\n\nItem wise, here is your time to add your own flair. I usually pick a combination that gives me high Weapon Speed and Power, just to ensure I heal even more every second. You can mix and match from my optional items below, but next Round I will have the exact items I tend to have by then",

        "notes": "Round 7: I usually just get Distortion since that's the one I tend to buy last, but you can always choose another Power if you prefer. Item-wise, I've already explained to get as much weapon power and speed as possible, so splurge on that!\n\nI've highlighted and said to buy Eye of the Spider, the 14,000 point item because it gives the most weapon power for 1 slot, and does more damage to low HP targets, allowing you to help clean up when you ult. The perfect balance between healing and DPS Mercy.\n\nAdvanced Nanobiotics gives a small boost of weapon power and 10% speed after you heal (so basically al the time as Mercy).\n\nIn Total with these stats. 55HPS base Mercy + 55% weapon power= 85.25HPS. With the weapon speed added (a total of 30% faster weapon speed with the Advanced NanoBiotics) that's 111HPS (about). When your target is half health or lower, it increases to about 121.5HPS. Neat.\n\nI also have some Optional Items for you to pick from. The Three-Tap Tommy Gun is an excellent choice for healers who realize they need to do DPS in order to win, but for Mercy it's soley for use during her ult, doing massive damage with her lil tic tac gun. The idea would be to Guardian Angel, shoot 3 times, fly, shoot, fly, shoot. Otherwise, more heals and speed is always an option!\n\nGood Luck, remember situational awareness, positioning, movement, and allow the idiots on your team to die if they're being dumb (they will be). Prioritize your best teammate (highest points on ur team) and your other healer. PLEASE heal your other healer. PLEASE",
