        "notes": "Before, I would tell you to get [Trinisphere](item_ffaf0527-137c-4fa6-8048-82f2c99f6d56) first due to it being the most effective Power for increasing your damage and therefore increasing the amount of money you can get. However, after some testing (and thanks to Eoghan for the suggestion), getting [Philharmonic Fortitude](item_e31e2686-cb66-4f89-9779-88a0cbc16e07) increases your survivability drastically thanks to the increased uptime of your Experimental Barrier. You do more damage when you're alive than when you're dead, after all!\n\nYou can probably still afford to get [Trinisphere](item_ffaf0527-137c-4fa6-8048-82f2c99f6d56) first depending on the matchup, but [Philharmonic Fortitude](item_e31e2686-cb66-4f89-9779-88a0cbc16e07) is the more consistently successful option overall for Round 1.\n\nDepending on the matchup, [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) might be a nice choice if you can keep your distance. [Field Rations](item_46ae6709-1166-426f-bca3-97a538d3f089) is also a potential option if it's a good map for it.\n\nYour main goal this round is to earn as much money as possible. If the enemy is playing grouped up often, spam your primary fire into them to get a lot of splash damage off. Cycle your abilities accordingly to prevent your Experimental Barrier breaking (though this should be relatively easy with [Philharmonic Fortitude](item_e31e2686-cb66-4f89-9779-88a0cbc16e07).",

Considering how slow Sigma's rate of fire is, increasing your attack speed will let you pump out a lot of damage. \n\nIf you're a bit short on money, grab [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) instead of [Velocity Vector](item_5ad7884b-ac8c-42f4-a5ad-359f43270540) (or grab both if you have a lot of money).

With this and the healing you get from your barriers, you'll be healing yourself for 9% of your Max Life! \n\nIf you're not facing a ton of pressure or if you're feeling confident, pick up [Antimatter](item_80887501-7855-40af-ab3c-c8c13a259e95) instead for some juicy extra damage. If you want to meet in the middle between offense and sustain, [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) can be helpful by boosting your damage while also gaining valuable lifesteal. It can be strong against the likes of [Junker Queen](hero_4794d288-27d9-49e0-a1dd-ffe0f4de3ab1) and [Orisa](hero_91644d44-1093-4f62-ac51-020975465e85) who don't have as many tools as other tanks to avoid getting hit by your primary fire. Do your best to keep your distance from them, though, to optimize your gains (and honestly keep your distance between these tanks in general, since they can be a bit difficult to deal with up close).\n\nLike last round, fill your empty item slots with more WP and/or attack speed.",

        "notes": "You have some flexibility now when picking a Power this round. You definitely want something to increase your offensive presence, as the enemy team can easily trample you with enough pressure. \n\nFor most matchups, getting [Trinisphere](item_ffaf0527-137c-4fa6-8048-82f2c99f6d56) is a solid choice to easily increase your damage output. With this Power, upgrade [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) with [Antimatter](item_80887501-7855-40af-ab3c-c8c13a259e95) to make it easier for you to deal damage if you miss directs hits or when targeting large groups. [Apogee Alignment](item_b2792d32-5b21-40df-9c71-be2ac3a59f27) can also be useful here for putting easy pressure on those who are really in your face.\n\nAn alternative route to go is to build more into Accretion with [Singularity](item_d5c3fffb-e066-4078-a4e5-a5ab383856f4) , which is useful against the likes of [Junker Queen](hero_4794d288-27d9-49e0-a1dd-ffe0f4de3ab1) and [D.Va](hero_e8e1dc68-45c4-47c2-b421-95e33594e6b6). It's an overall solid pick if your team needs some crowd control or if some of the enemy team likes to play out of position. If you do go this route, get [The Harness](item_f076e6bc-f185-437a-bbc3-e599919990c8) instead of [Antimatter](item_80887501-7855-40af-ab3c-c8c13a259e95). You don't have to put too much money into AP since your best pressure tool is still your primary fire. Items that give both WP and AP such as [Phantasmic Flux](item_5e644a79-cf6e-4196-8d0a-232f75004643) and [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) are good options here, though.\n\nRegardless of what path you take, if you're against heroes like [Reinhardt](hero_a3b6ca2c-6cbd-43dc-bb78-a728e42fba49) that may build heavily into attack speed, also consider getting [Weapon Jammer](item_72386db6-753e-413d-aa2a-f1389842f47f) now or later, since them rushing you down can be very overwhelming.",

        "notes": "[Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) has the added benefit of helping you reposition a bit if you're in a sticky situation and have to use Kinetic Grasp or Accretion. [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) complements well with your primary fire's quick bursts of damage. If you're still short on money at this point, do the best you can to maximize your damage output with what you can afford.\n\nI've only tried a couple of powers in the this round with varying success. Some of those include [Event Horizon](item_01720c0d-74a0-4c6a-8f75-c9e1fe908186) and [Astrophysical](item_7749452f-3c0e-45a9-9c32-f561aa7fb41e), and both of them seemed to have some good to them for their own reasons (increasing your barriers' uptimes for the former and giving yourself a \"get off me\" tool for the latter). [Apogee Alignment](item_b2792d32-5b21-40df-9c71-be2ac3a59f27) might also be able to work if they're really in your face. \n\nI haven't tried using [Hyperloop](item_aea2ba3d-76a7-44f1-b12f-88a04f4d68bb) either, but it might be useful against heroes like [D.Va](hero_e8e1dc68-45c4-47c2-b421-95e33594e6b6) and [Junker Queen](hero_4794d288-27d9-49e0-a1dd-ffe0f4de3ab1) who have no means of blocking it.",
