The moment an enemy drops below 50%, you're gaining bonus weapon power and speed to eliminate them. Moira excels in chasing low-HP targets, so lean into that.\n\nEngagement Strategy: Use Fade aggressively to reposition behind or between enemies. \n\nOrb Usage: Toss damage orbs into enclosed spaces to create split pressure and finish off targets escaping line of sight. You\u2019ll also continue getting Cross-Orbal value, not for heavy burst, but for map control and disruption.\n\nPositioning: You are not a backline healer here. If you feel vulnerable, play a perpendicular off-angle from your team. If you're feeling strong, commit to full backline. You\u2019ll want to dance in and out with Fade, baiting and finishing.\n\nItem Timing Tip: The Closer\u2019s value increases with aggressive positioning. Look for weakened tanks or split supports, pop Fade, and commit.",

        "notes": "Execution Window: Lead with Damage Orb to activate Chain Grasp, then snap to the squishiest target. The chain will clean up nearby enemies, increasing pressure while allowing you to drain more energy if needed.\n\nOrb Usage: Activating Chain Grasp is essential, so throw Damage Orb early, then immediately right-click on a grouped target. Don't forget that Chain Grasp will also trigger on throwing out a healing orb as well. \n\nChase/Pressure: With El-Sa\u2019ka Suppressor added, you're now also reducing enemy healing when you deal damage. Use this in tandem with Chain Grasp to punish grouped supports or deny tank sustain.\n\nTeamfight Role: You\u2019re becoming a damage amplifier for your team. Hit multiple targets with the chain to soften them up, and coordinate with your DPS to finish kills.\n\nPositioning Tip: Position slightly off-angle from your frontliners. You want to catch enemies near each other in your Chain Grasp cone, ideally at 10m or less for maximum uptime.",

Your lifesteal and armor now work together to keep you topped up during pressure.\n\nOptional Survivability Swaps: If you're still getting focused or bursted:\n\nVanadium Injection \u2013 Adds a ton of stats as long as you don't use your Ult. That being said, if you're about to lose a round and are desperate for clean-up or keep your teammates from dying, don't play selfishly and hold onto it.\n\nPhantasmic Flux \u2013 Adds up to 100 overhealth on lifesteal. If the enemy team is smart they will start trying to get rid of you as quickly as possible. This can provide great sustain and keep you in the fight longer.\n\nIron Eyes - Reduces incoming critical damage by 30%. Against Cassidy, Ashe, or similar high-crit heroes, this can be the difference between survival and instant death. Highly recommended if you're being targeted by crit-focused DPS.\n\nAdvanced Engagements: Start fights by pressuring from off-angles. The higher the rounds go, the less success you're going to have going pure backline. Vital-E-Tee ensures you survive the commitment, especially when combo\u2019d with heals from teammates or map health packs.",
