All the core items and powers were left untouched except for  [Crowd Pleaser](item_ae569e40-3194-4681-b1da-c664d0fa982c). Thankfully, crowd please got a buff so you'll be able to GIGA heal allies when you're amping.",

I've had games where the enemy tank just bullies our tank and so the extra knockback helps our tank sustain a lot more. \n\nThis is a niche situation, but if there's an enemy Queen with [Dez\u2019s Damage Dampeners](item_d55fc98b-d014-4383-903c-a7aa1fb7c619), I highly suggest going for [Beat Drop](item_d3d5876b-bd40-4bd9-9954-c65e2295cc2d). If you picked  [Let\u2019s Bounce](item_2d846a6e-ff59-4ccc-ae90-c78fad3b4d9b), you **HAVE** to pair it with [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98). I still don't recommend picking [Let\u2019s Bounce](item_2d846a6e-ff59-4ccc-ae90-c78fad3b4d9b) against a queen. I'd rather just build beat faster, avoid booping her and not sink money for 1 purple item to SORT of counter her blue item. (I despise that item a lot)\n\nIf no one or only 1 teammate has [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505), buy it. If you have 2-3 teammates running [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505), I usually go for [All-Out Auditiva](item_7e33b7e7-4f7a-4f9f-bc25-39ce2a8f56b2) instead for the prolonged big heals.\n\nIf dive's a problem, [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) feels nice.\n\nIf you can't afford last purple, DEFINITELY keep [#1 Single](item_5c5d5331-2966-440b-b989-aa92187eef97).\n\nIf you can't afford the last 2 purples, stick with [#1 Single](item_5c5d5331-2966-440b-b989-aa92187eef97) and [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n6/1/2025 [Airwaves](item_8dd41d05-7f65-4795-a179-ec8dc40d7824) item edit: This item is bad to get consistent value off from. As it stands, you'd have to setup up wallriding up high to get 25% or 50%. Usually you're getting 25% more sound barrier at best per game. That's roughly 100-200 more hp from proccing that 25%. I would rather run [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) instead or  [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98) , as you get to apply said debuff every 3-4 seconds with boop. Overall, airwaves sucks.\n\n6/14/2025 [#1 Single](item_5c5d5331-2966-440b-b989-aa92187eef97) item edit: I just noticed that when your teammates leave your circle and your aura still lingers on them because of [#1 Single](item_5c5d5331-2966-440b-b989-aa92187eef97), you can use **boop** to give them a small burst of heal from [Crowd Pleaser](item_ae569e40-3194-4681-b1da-c664d0fa982c).",
