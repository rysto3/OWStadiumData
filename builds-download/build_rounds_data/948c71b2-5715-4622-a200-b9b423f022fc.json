Having 2 torpedoes charges is really strong and more consistent compared to the other torpedo powers.\n\nFor Item:\nFirst Aid and Power Play are always grabbed on round 1. For the third option, you have 3 items that you can pick. Compensator, Charged Plating, and Shady Spectacles. I think Compensator is usually the most consistent but feel free to pick the other two if you want to push for your torpedoes more.",

        "notes": "Power:\nYou can't go wrong with Cosmic Coolant or Medicinal Missiles. I like Coolant more due to having more Torpedoes uptime which also leads to having your over Shields more.\n\n\nItems: Fort-Glide makes you much more tanky and gives 75 shields. A really good choice. If you can't afford Fort-Glide, Reinforced Titanium or Iron Eyes give you more shields and damage reduction.\n\nIf you want to push for ability instead: Iridescent Iris gives you 20% ability damage and shorter cool downs. If you can't afford Iridescent, Nano Cola is always a solid choice due to its raw 15% ability damage. Multi-Tool is also another great cheap option if you rather have shower cooldowns.\n\n\nSide Note: Starting around Round 3, You can decide if you want to focus more on survivability or ability power. It heavily depends on your interactions with the enemy team. If they can't kill/pressure you, Go for the ability damage. If you can't survive long, go for more shields. For this stadium build, I will design it to be more tanky with some ability damage. I will also assume that the player is getting around average points. Feel free to buy more expensive items early if you can. it's important to build around both survival and ability but feel free to go full tank if that brings you more joy.",

I went with Stellar Focus due to its synergy with Sunburst Serum but You could make a case for Torpedo Glide due to this build just spamming missiles which allows it to have more uptime. I don't have the most experience with this build for round 7, only time will tell.\n\nFor items: I added Iridescent Iris due to its cooldown reduction and its added ability damage. If you have more credits, you should be able to have 5 purple items. Feel free to add more ability or survival depending on what's needed for the win.",
