        "notes": "Strategy: Generally play close to your tank. Use dynamite on cooldown, and coach gun any burning targets that are under 75% health, actively getting shot, or diving you/your backline. Your scoped primary fire is only supplemental, so taking high ground only removes you from the action.\n\nNote: Coach gun's range is a lot further than you may expect as it's a projectile, use this to your advantage. This means it can also be deflected by Genji/Orisa, so be wary in these match-ups.\n\n[Incendiary Blast](item_2660993e-698c-4ea0-9a65-6b1fd02f38df) is the obvious choice for the first power. It deals a ton of damage this early, especially if you ensure that enemies are dynamited first if possible for the 82.5 damage burst. In total, one coach gun hit will deal 202.5 damage. When adding dynamite, this comes to 382.5 over 5 seconds.\n\nThis power makes flankers fear you, and forces the enemy supports to expend a lot of resources across their team when used properly. As the damage isn't split between targets, try to hit as many people as possible for maximum value.\n\nWe take [Winning Attitude](item_8714087c-c078-4619-a2ef-327bc6edaa69) to help fuel  [Charged Plating](item_b8ca58e7-6ae2-40ee-8618-fe2f32315295), try to use your ult early to get the \"free\" 25 armor and 10% AP -- very good for a 1k investment.",

This gives you a lot of freedom in being able to activate dynamite on enemies around shields/deflects/matrix, enabling higher damage and granting a sizable amount of extra money from assists and the aforementioned damage. The AP % boost is also reasonable for the cost.\n\nAs people likely haven't invested heavily into survival yet, you can also stack AP and take [Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) and [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) if you can't yet afford  [Stacked Sticks](item_2ad5dace-ac3c-43fe-b20b-3add489a7207).\n\nAbility lifesteal -- while tempting -- is not very effective yet. At this round, you'll rarely surpass 150 healing with 10% lifesteal, hence [Custom Stock](item_17d633af-8bcc-4893-b865-be0a7bc66fe2) will likely beat [Energized Bracers](item_f83a1d9e-91f8-4d2c-bd62-c673b8d9fd2e) if taking the lower budget build route.",

This means that you can deal 507 damage with a double coach gun on burning targets (or use the first coach gun shot to ignite for still respectable damage).\n\nIn addition to the damage, you're also more likely to have coach gun up when getting dove. You now have the power to easily kill Genji, and should be able to force a Reaper retreat with one coach gun. If the DVA built into damage, your coach gun can easily de-mech at this round.\n\n[Nano Cola](item_79b22609-8046-4a8a-a5a2-bb49cd7e11c6) is a good idea at this point to stack more early AP, you don't really need any additional effects yet. \n\nIf your supports aren't great or you're being target dove, consider selling AP items to get [Firestarter](item_8b678022-0eeb-4535-8413-8ad1dbda82d3) early.

        "notes": "May 29th edit: [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) is still my top pick, but I would seriously consider the other two mentioned options after the buff especially if the enemy tank is using shield rein after his buff (which I'm expecting will be common). [Molten Munitions](item_a784dd14-8d4d-4f3b-81f4-371c9979593e) if you have high AP, [Out with a Bang](item_0c3398a1-34aa-48d0-81c1-0e4f1cf4f739) if you have [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) or [Liquid Nitrogen](item_a8d99526-05a3-4405-babb-b025479b1b98). See round 7 edits for more details.\n\nStrategy: [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) grants a lot of freedom for your playstyle. Use it to stack damage with coach gun for single target, or spread burns across two additional players to expend the enemy support's resources. This damage counts as a burn, doesn't have falloff, and is fully effective while hip firing: get creative!\n\n[Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) is a multifaceted pick, and is likely the best option here unless you're specifically trying to specifically counter another build. If you're really not confident in your aim, [Molten Munitions](item_a784dd14-8d4d-4f3b-81f4-371c9979593e) or [Out with a Bang](item_0c3398a1-34aa-48d0-81c1-0e4f1cf4f739) would be acceptable low intensity options for this round. Specifically, [Molten Munitions](item_a784dd14-8d4d-4f3b-81f4-371c9979593e) can be valuable depending on the map, and can help against Rein players that don't respect personal space.\n\nBoth [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) shots combined with the current AP will grant 124 damage in total over 3 seconds even if you hip fire. This damage stacks and you do not need to wait for the first instance to end to proc the second.\n\nIn my testing, [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) actually counts as a burn effect which grants a nice synergy with [Firestarter](item_8b678022-0eeb-4535-8413-8ad1dbda82d3) and [Incendiary Blast](item_2660993e-698c-4ea0-9a65-6b1fd02f38df).",

        "notes": "[Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) is a great pickup here, as it's triggered by almost everything you do, including [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) shots. This allows you to partially anti most of the enemy team very frequently.\n\nIt's also worth considering going the boring route and seriously stacking AP if you find your team has utility but is lacking damage.  [Champion's Kit](item_8682f8c7-8811-439b-8d50-fa81cd43ddce) is a very noticeable upgrade. Depending on your money, [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) is very much worth slotting still too if you need additional burst damage.\n\n[Infrared Lenses](item_f19df350-745e-4e97-a495-8036b0be1262) is theoretically also a good choice here, but in my testing it's like a worse middle-ground between stacking DOT and burst damage. The AP is nice, and I would consider buying it if the two aforementioned items are too expensive (remember to always have enough money to slot [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) for the most cost effective AP).",

Realistically, aim for no less than 75% AP and ensure that you have [Firestarter](item_8b678022-0eeb-4535-8413-8ad1dbda82d3) (which can carry your survivability single-handedly).\n\nIf you need to remove any of these items to fit your budget, first I'd replace [Cybervenom](item_210a8582-91ec-4cf3-968a-a443f3a0c505) if a teammate already has healing reduction or if the enemy supports don't seem great. Otherwise, [Mark of the Kitsune](item_09a53e39-25aa-4f66-ba51-bedbc543a1eb) could be removed for [Power Playbook](item_6d8803cf-baa7-46ee-af91-51e7f2301418) -- its burst damage is helpful, but it doesn't do much for your burns. [Firestarter](item_8b678022-0eeb-4535-8413-8ad1dbda82d3) and [Stacked Sticks](item_2ad5dace-ac3c-43fe-b20b-3add489a7207) should not be removed under any circumstances.\n\nYour 4th power has a few good options:\n\n- May 29th edit: After the buffs, I'd consider the [My Business, My Rules](item_0dac0a70-77f1-4560-8a4d-16304c022552) choice less obvious. The other two powers could even beat [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) under the right circumstances. Realistically I don't think there's a bad pick, just be smart based on this info in how you pick into the enemy tank.\n\n[My Business, My Rules](item_0dac0a70-77f1-4560-8a4d-16304c022552) is my preference, as your cooldowns should always be at least halved in duration when used properly. You'll likely be spamming shots for [Calamity](item_d6cdfbfe-61f4-4aa2-979f-f7793000b15c) anyways, so it synergizes well without much extra consideration.\n\n- May 29th edit: After the recent buffs, [Out with a Bang](item_0c3398a1-34aa-48d0-81c1-0e4f1cf4f739) will actually deal decent damage and isn't just a tool to spread burns.\n\n[Out with a Bang](item_0c3398a1-34aa-48d0-81c1-0e4f1cf4f739) is also seriously worth considering, especially if the enemy team as a lot of cleanses (Zarya, Kiriko, Moira). They'll either have to eat a burn, or use a lot of abilities to cover both rounds of explosives. You can also manually trigger the extra explosives, staggering their effect even more. This is less about damage and more about guaranteeing burn coverage in an unfavorable match-up. Consider taking [Furnace Fuel](item_aac67acc-e7d0-4465-b3d3-1276a6de0f86) if choosing this power against Zarya, Kiriko, or Moira.\n\n- May 29th edit: [Molten Munitions](item_a784dd14-8d4d-4f3b-81f4-371c9979593e) is now up to 152 dps @ 90% AP which is respectable. If the enemies are often clumped then this may win out over other options. Likely less effective as the ranks go higher.\n\n[Molten Munitions](item_a784dd14-8d4d-4f3b-81f4-371c9979593e) is probably the worst of the good options. With our AP, it deals 97 DPS and heals you for 34/s. This sounds great in theory, but the AOE is relatively small and it's hard to trigger around shield/deflect heavy comps. I would only take this if you notice the enemy is often clumped together, or if the last map is \"Temple of Anubis\".",
