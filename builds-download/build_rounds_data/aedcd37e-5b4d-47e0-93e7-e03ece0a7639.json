(You can switch it out for Healing/DPS build if DPS are doing bad when at 3rd power, just look on my profile for those builds)\n\n## Power\n\nI always pick  [Threads of Fate](item_cb61612b-9d83-49a9-989d-013bf084fbcb)  as a first power, just because you get so much value out of it on the first round.\n\n## Items\n\nYou want to pick  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0)  because it increases your healing **output**.  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)  increases how **fast** you heal.  [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da)  is so you can stay **alive** a bit more and regenerate your HP quickly during fights. If you prefer/are more used to it, you can grab  [Armored Vest](item_358361e2-59be-4c81-b221-8a87f37809e6) instead, but 25 shields + faster regen is better in general AND you're gonna want to keep  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf)  and  [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) no matter which survivability perk you choose.\n\n\n## Items NOT to pick\n\n- Literally anything in Ability Power. Anything with Ability Power is useless to mercy because her abilities are : \"Guardian Angel\" and \"Resurrection\". Ability Power does nothing for either of these. If you pick an AP build with AP powers later in the game, it makes slightly more sense but there are better options out there than building AP on mercy.\n\n-  [Field Rations](item_46ae6709-1166-426f-bca3-97a538d3f089) :\nYou're not supposed to stay on the objective, you're supposed to stick with whoever is doing the most amount of damage.\n\n- Beginning of rounds/Death perks:\nIt's not that it's bad but there are better options out there. (+ You're not supposed to be dying as mercy so if you're dying maybe put your money in survivability over death perks)\n\n- Lifesteal/Ammo/Elimination perks: \nDuring the first round you want to play like a good little mercy so you can scope out the enemy team and then eventually build DPS mercy if that's what your team needs.",

(Even chain Evoker, which will be taken around round 3)\n\n-  [Long Distance Wings](item_8b4bafad-c8bc-4c77-bbe7-798b03920c88) :\nYou don't need Ability Power and if you REALLY need GA Range (Which you don't), wait until 3rd round to get  [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) .\n\n-  [Aerodynamic Feathers](item_03d95229-b91d-48c0-b1e3-c8075b678ef0) and  [Angeleisure Wear](item_00b53ed7-0768-442b-a2c3-8d19608c9391) :\nIf you absolutely need movement, like you can't go by without it, getting  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) paired with a green survivability perk and using the rest of your money for WP/AS is the more intelligent choice. You get more movement so you automatically get less Dmg taken, and you go a lot faster.\n\n- [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) :\nSince we're doing a DMG amp focused build, if your dps is dying too much, you need to heal him more.

Literally the best movement you can have on mercy on stadium, less than 1s cooldown + launches very far. Can also be useful for healing if u GA every 3s to someone low, your healing with be constantly up 30%.

        "notes": "# About this build\n\nIf ur dps are crazy, you can use this pocket build. (You can switch it out for Healing/DPS build if DPS are doing bad when at 3rd power, just look on my profile for those builds)\n\n## Items\n\nFor the 6th round, you're gonna want to fit as many purple perks as you can. If you don't need to die less, don't pick the movement purples that are optional but  [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b)  and  [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) . ONLY if you already have the 4 purples that are already in the list. You want to be using GA as much as possible to get maximum value out of  [Hardlight Accelerator](item_0390c8af-2a68-4da2-b876-93da32c3f448) . The reason for picking that perk instead of  [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce)  for example, is that 1. It ends up adding the same amount of Weapon Boost if you use GA often enough, which I do, and 2. You also get 10% Cooldown. So it gives more while costing less, which to me sounds like a great deal !\n\n\n## Items NOT to pick\n\n- Literally anything in Ability Power. Anything with Ability Power is useless to mercy because her abilities are : \"Guardian Angel\" and \"Resurrection\". Ability Power does nothing for either of these. If you pick an AP build with AP powers later in the game, it makes slightly more sense but there are better options out there than building AP on mercy.\n\n-  [Long Distance Wings](item_8b4bafad-c8bc-4c77-bbe7-798b03920c88) :\nYou don't need Ability Power and if you REALLY need GA Range (Which you don't), wait until 3rd round to get  [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) .\n\n-  [Long Distance Wings](item_8b4bafad-c8bc-4c77-bbe7-798b03920c88) :\nYou don't need Ability Power and if you REALLY need GA Range (Which you don't), wait until 3rd round to get  [Caduceus Ex](item_9e7965ea-2abc-44a7-b042-950c6ad2fce7) .\n\n-  [Aerodynamic Feathers](item_03d95229-b91d-48c0-b1e3-c8075b678ef0) and  [Angeleisure Wear](item_00b53ed7-0768-442b-a2c3-8d19608c9391) :\nIf you absolutely need movement, like you can't go by without it, getting  [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) paired with a green survivability perk and using the rest of your money for WP/AS is the more intelligent choice. You get more movement so you automatically get less Dmg taken, and you go a lot faster.\n\n-  [Resurrection Rangefinder](item_99baffec-51b5-42e4-be61-e29f3de8219f) :\nWith all the powers we've chosen so far, you're supposed to be able to keep up your team while still pocketing. If you're rezzing too much / needing a rez perk to not die while rezzing, maybe those rezzes are not worth it/too dangerous OR focus on more healing perks to not have to rez.
