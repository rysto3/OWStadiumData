        "notes": "# **Round 1 \u2013 \u201cStabilize and Scale\u201d Mercy**\n\n## **Power: Threads of Fate**\n\nYour build opens with **Threads of Fate**, and for good reason\u2014this is arguably one of the strongest openers for support players who want early presence without needing to lean on burst stats.\n\n- The beam chaining mechanic mirrors your current beam onto your previous target. That means if you flick from healing to damage boost on your current target, the previous target receives that same effect too, in real time.\n\n- This allows you to double your utility without needing full scaling yet\u2014you\u2019re controlling both outputs with one action.\n\n- To keep Threads active, you must swap targets every ~2.5\u20133 seconds. If you stay locked onto one target too long, the chain breaks.\n\n*Pro tip: Don\u2019t worry about saving Valk. With Threads of Fate and early beam efficiency, you\u2019ll often have Valk ready before the enemy support does. Use it as often as possible\u2014every cast gives your team a tempo swing and accelerates your next ult. Stadium Mercy thrives on consistent ult cycling, not hoarding.*\n\n## Items:\n\n [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) \n\n- Boosts your healing and boost beam output from the jump.\n\n- Especially good under Threads, where every tick of both beams scales off WP.\n\n [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) \n\n- Mercy\u2019s healing beam operates through rapid healing \u201cticks\u201d, not a smooth continuous flow.\n\n- In Stadium Mode, Attack Speed determines how frequently those healing ticks occur\u2014faster ticks = more healing applied per second.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n- Weapon Power = how strong each tick is\n\n- Attack Speed = how many times per second those ticks happen\n\nTogether, they multiply your effective healing rate.\n\n- Even a +5% increase makes your beam feel smoother, more responsive, and helps charge Valkyrie faster, especially when paired with Threads of Fate.\n\n- Often overlooked, but the synergy between WP \u00d7 AS means this gives multiplicative scaling when paired with Compensator.\n\n [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) \n\n- Grants 25 shield HP, bringing your effective total to 250 HP\u2014giving you just enough buffer to survive early poke, chip damage, or a surprise body shot.\n\n- The real strength of this item lies in its regen utility: it reduces the delay before your natural healing kicks in by 33%.\n\n- Normally, Mercy must wait ~2 seconds without taking damage before her self-heal starts; with this item, that wait drops to ~1.3 seconds.\n\n- This lets you escape and start regenerating health sooner, which pairs extremely well with her mobility and defensive positioning.\n\n- Unlike Zenyatta or Sigma, the shield doesn\u2019t regenerate itself\u2014but your faster regen delay makes it easier to top yourself off between fights or while kiting.\n\n## Round 1 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Flick between targets regularly to maintain Threads. The beam mirror only works if the link stays active.\n\n- Start by healing your tank or a diving flank, then flick to boost a high-value DPS during downtime.\n\n- Use Guardian Angel carefully\u2014you don\u2019t have enhanced mobility yet, so prioritize safe repositioning over aggressive flight.\n\n- Let your 25 shield buffer absorb chip damage. This helps you stall until passive regen kicks in.\n\n- Use Valkyrie often. Its cooldown is short, and you can chain fights together by ulting early and rebuilding charge quickly.",

        "notes": "# **Round 2 \u2013 Movement is Survival Mercy**\n\nYou don\u2019t pick up a second power in Round 2. Instead, your focus is on survivability, mobility, and beam uptime through stat-efficient green-tier items. This is a momentum round\u2014you're not trying to power-spike just yet, but you're laying the groundwork for one.\n\n*The best Mercy build is the one that keeps you alive long enough to keep enabling your team. Round 2 is about making sure you live through fights\u2014not just support them.*\n\n## Items:\n\n [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) \n\nGrants +50 bonus core HP, pushing your total to 250 or 300 HP, depending on whether you\u2019ve kept First Aid Kit or sold it to afford this pickup.\n\nIncreases your launch velocity by 25% when canceling Guardian Angel with crouch or jump.\n\nThis is arguably Mercy\u2019s most important early-game movement item. It gives you:\n\n- Better vertical lift when slingshotting\n\n- Faster escape launches out of danger\n\n- More reliable midair movement when Valkyrie is active\n\nIn short: if you\u2019re not mobile, you\u2019re not Mercy. This item fixes that.\n\n*If needed, sell any or all items from the previous round to obtain this item. The movement value is worth the tradeoff in most matchups.*\n\n[Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) \n\n- Carried over from Round 1.\n\n- Still gives consistent value on all beam output (especially with Threads of Fate still active).\n\n- Continues to be one of the most stat-efficient green items.\n\n [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) \n\n- Also carried over from Round 1.\n\n- Boosts healing tick rate and synergizes with WP.\n\n- Multiplies healing effectiveness without needing new investment.\n\n [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) \n\n- Kept for the regen timing bonus\u2014it allows you to start recovering sooner after disengaging from fights.\n\n- That 33% reduction means you start regenerating at ~1.3s instead of 2s, making it easier to bounce back between fights.\n\n- Combined with Blessed Boosters, this makes you hard to finish off when repositioning.\n\n- If sold to afford Boosters, you\u2019ll lose some early sustain but gain much more safety through movement.\n\n## Optional Items to Bridge With (Don\u2019t Buy Yet):\n\nThese are the transitional items you may want to grab in Round 3\u20134 if your gold doesn\u2019t stretch to an Epic:\n\n [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) - +10% AS, +5% MS: a clean tempo item for keeping beams smoother and repositioning faster\n\n [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) - +5% WP; grants +10% AS for 3s after healing: strong synergy with Valk\u2019s constant multi-target healing\n\n [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) - +15% WP: pure beam power for aggressive ult tempo or carry-style sustain\n\n*You\u2019re not buying these yet\u2014just keeping them on your radar if you need to pivot next round.*\n\n## Round 2 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Practice \u201cslingshot launching\u201d with crouch and jump cancels\u2014Blessed Boosters will now give you serious height and burst distance.\n\n- Try to bounce between low ground and high ground whenever possible, especially when healing isn\u2019t urgent. This helps you avoid dive and farm Valk in safety.\n\n- Your healing isn\u2019t spiking yet, but your uptime is\u2014this round is about staying alive through more cycles of Threads and Valk.\n\n## Round Goal:\n\nBecome untouchable. Set up your escape options. Build Valk rhythm.\nRound 2 is where you stop being an easy kill. Your healing is stable, your escape routes are vertical, and your regen is faster than most supports. This is the round where you start feeling like Mercy\u2014and your ult becomes a consistent tool, not a panic button.",

Mercy\u2019s normal healing can sometimes feel too slow to recover a critical teammate\u2014Triage Unit changes that.\n\n- Triggers automatically when you GA to a low-health ally\u2014no button press needed.\n\n- Applies a +30% healing buff for 3 seconds, letting you triage key allies out of burst zones or clean up dives that would normally get them killed.\n\n- Works seamlessly with Threads of Fate\u2014once it activates, your previous beam target will also receive boosted healing (as long as you\u2019re healing your current target).\n\n- While Valkyrie gives you greater field access, Triage still only activates after GA-ing to a low-health ally\u2014you\u2019ll need to reposition actively to make the most of it. That said, the increased visibility and freedom during Valk make it easier to target the right teammate when it matters.\n\n## Items:\n\n [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) \n\n- Retained from Round 2. Still the core of your survivability and positioning.\n\n- As fights become more ult-heavy, vertical escape and midair control become essential\u2014especially when staying in Valk or weaving through contested space.\n\n [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) \n\n- This item creates momentum after every beam swap.\n\n- Every time you start healing someone (especially during GA), you gain +10% Attack Speed for 3s.\n\nThis synergizes extremely well with Threads, Triage, and Valk:\n\n- Faster beam ticks\n\n- Shorter downtime between ult charges\n\n- More responsive flick healing\n\nThe WP bonus is modest, but the AS proc makes this item scale very quickly.\n\n [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) \n\n- Flat +10% Attack Speed gives you a big beam frequency bump across the board.\n\n- +5% Move Speed subtly improves GA pathing and recovery options.\n\n- This is a tempo enhancer\u2014you feel faster, more fluid, and your healing \u201clands\u201d more efficiently under pressure.\n\n [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) \n\n- A raw healing and damage boost beam amplifier.\n\n- Scales harder than Compensator and becomes your core WP spike.\n\n- In this round, you\u2019re beginning to build toward carry-level beam stats, and this item is the turning point.\n\nOptional Items (depending on gold or performance):\n\nIf you\u2019re underperforming or need to pivot, consider retaining or re-purchasing one of these:\n\n [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) - +5% WP: Stackable with Talon Mod if you\u2019re gold-rich.\n\n [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) - +5% AS: Can smooth beam output if Nanobiotics isn\u2019t enough.\n\n [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) -  +25 Shield, Regen Delay: Still a good pick if you're struggling to survive dives or poke.\n\n## Round 3 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Use GA intentionally\u2014try to trigger Triage by dashing to the most injured ally in a cluster. Even if they\u2019re not your final beam target, the 3s boost gives you time to flick to someone else and still keep both alive.\n\n- Under Valkyrie, the synergy between Triage, Threads, and Advanced Nanobiotics is huge\u2014you\u2019ll chain AS buffs naturally and cover your team with amplified healing.\n\n- If you're facing burst comps (Tracer, Widow, Junkrat), you now have the tools to recover midfight instead of retreating. Stay present longer.\n\n- Your movement isn\u2019t just escape\u2014it\u2019s a healing decision-maker. You can now path into fights to save allies instead of always retreating.\n\n## Round Goal:\n\nStabilize high-risk fights. Accelerate Valk uptime. Move with intent.\nRound 3 is where you stop just supporting\u2014you start controlling tempo. Between your launch buffs, AS spikes, and emergency healing burst, you can now swing a fight from unwinnable to stabilized with a single GA and flick.",

        "notes": "# **Round 4 \u2013 Epic Scaling & Valk Economy Online**\n\nNo additional power this round\u2014because your gold is best spent scaling your item core.\nTriage and Threads already give you strong reactive and multi-target value. Round 4 is all about turning that kit into a mid-to-late game engine through three epic-tier items.\n\n*This is a \u201cpower-buy\u201d round. If Round 3 made you reactive, Round 4 makes you proactive. You're not waiting for fights to stabilize\u2014you\u2019re forcing them into your tempo.*\n\n## Items:\n\n [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) \n\n- This is your primary healing spike item and your first must-buy epic.\n\n- Grants bonus HP, a flat +15% Weapon Power, and increases healing output by another 15% when targeting allies below 50% life.\n\n- Synergizes directly with Triage Unit\u2014when triggered together, you\u2019ll be healing critical teammates 45% harder (30% from Triage + 15% from Amari\u2019s), letting you swing losing fights and stabilize dives that would otherwise be unrecoverable.\n\n- Works perfectly with Threads of Fate: the amplified healing applies to your previous beam target as long as you\u2019re healing the current one.\n\n*If you can only afford one item this round: get Amari\u2019s.*\n\n [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) \n\n- The core tempo tool for all Valk-focused Mercies.\n\n- Grants a flat +20% Attack Speed, letting your beams tick faster across all healing and boost actions.\n\n- When you use Guardian Angel or Valkyrie, you get +10% Move Speed for 2 seconds\u2014great for kiting, escape, and proactive repositioning.\n\n- Especially powerful when you\u2019re flicking between beams and repositioning mid-fight: you\u2019re now able to dodge, glide, and beam simultaneously.\n\n*Movement is survivability\u2014but now it's also a DPS tool. Faster movement = better beam uptime = faster ult generation.*\n\n [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) \n\n- Still one of your most important items even in Round 4.\n\n- You\u2019ll need the vertical escape more than ever as teamfights become ult-heavy and mobility-dependent.\n\n- Still synergizes with Valk and Booster Jets\u2014now you can launch higher, move faster, and stay airborne with precision, making it harder for enemy hitscans or divers to land damage.\n\n- Stacked with Booster Jets, you now have both vertical and directional mobility tools\u2014a must for surviving burst and isolating high-priority allies.\n\n## Optional/Bridge Items:\n\nIf you\u2019re short on gold, you may retain or cycle in one of these until your full build locks:\n\n [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) - Great synergy with Amari\u2019s healing trigger windows\n\n [Aftermarket Firing Pin](item_2485b212-b286-42d0-a2bd-20eb4396b054) - If you still need smoother healing or movement early this round\n\n [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) -  Still solid for flat WP boosts, but now outscaled by Amari\u2019s\n\n [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) - If your team has strong poke/burst and you want to enable faster ult economy via boost chaining (also adds Armor)\n\n** Round 4 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Amari's + Triage is your critical care combo. When a teammate drops below 50%, Guardian Angel into them and hold the beam: that\u2019s up to 45% bonus healing for 3 seconds.\n\n- Use Valkyrie aggressively to apply healing while repositioning\u2014your AS and MS buffs mean you can multitask better than any other support.\n\n- Lean into flick-healing behavior: dash to low HP allies to trigger Triage, then flick back to stabilize others. Your movement speed and chain healing will make it feel seamless.\n\n- You now have enough AS and WP to handle burst windows without needing to fully reset.\n\n- If your team is poke-heavy, consider swapping in Chain Evoker soon to boost ult charge via damage boost chains.\n\n## Round Goal:\n\nBecome the engine. Heal faster. Move sharper. Recover deeper.\nRound 4 turns you into a teamfight stabilizer and initiator. You\u2019re not just a beam bot\u2014you\u2019re the heartbeat of your team. If someone\u2019s alive at 1 HP, they\u2019re alive because of you.",

        "notes": "# **Round 5 \u2013 Valk Flow & Meta-Adapted Armor Spike**\n\nPower Addition:  [Crepuscular Circle](item_c0b93ed2-b692-44d5-a38a-ce5a63e83cdb) \n\nThis is the centerpiece power for Mercy\u2019s endgame tempo engine.\n\nDuring Valkyrie, this power automatically radiates your staff\u2019s effect to nearby allies\u2014whatever you\u2019re doing (healing or boosting), everyone around you receives it.\n\nThis turns Mercy into a true AoE support, enabling you to sustain your entire team with no beam-swapping required.\n\nIt also frees up your inputs, letting you focus on movement, spacing, and even weapon usage.\n\nSynergizes beautifully with:\n\n- Threads of Fate \u2013 for dual coverage outside of Valk\n\n- Triage Unit \u2013 for spot-saving low-HP allies as you reposition\n\n- Amari\u2019s Antidote + Chain Evoker \u2013 for scaling healing and ult charge from passive beam uptime\n\n*Think of Crepuscular as a beam amplifier\u2014you choose the effect, Valk handles the rest. And because your beams are applied passively, you\u2019re now free to pull out your pistol during Valk. With increased Weapon Power from Amari\u2019s and other items, this is your window to pressure squishies, punish overextensions, or peel\u2014without sacrificing healing.*\n\n## Items:\n\n [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) \n\n- Grants WP, bonus healing to low-health allies, and HP buffer.\n\n- Still the backbone of your clutch healing output, especially in bursty mid-fight phases.\n\n [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) \n\n- Keeps you mobile and safe, especially under dive threat.\n\n- In Valk, the ability to reposition midair while channeling AoE beam effects is incredibly powerful.\n\n [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) \n\n- Still critical to your tempo: faster beam ticks, more Valk generation, smoother control over repositions.\n\n- Adds MS burst that lets you rotate from one critical target to the next.\n\n [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) \n\n- Adds +50 Armor, increasing your ability to survive chip and ult poke\u2014especially important in a meta where poke damage and sustain wars are longer.\n\n- Grants +5% damage boost and +15% ult charge from damage boosted teammates, letting you maintain a high Valk uptime.\n\n- This is your meta adaptation pick: it leans into survivability and economy at once.\n\n*You\u2019re now a teamwide support and ult battery\u2014not just a beam pocket.*\n\n## Optional / Previously-Owned Items:\n\nThese are items you may still have from earlier rounds or may cycle back in if you\u2019re experimenting with loadouts. Just make sure you\u2019re always maximizing your spending\u2014if you can\u2019t afford a full epic, it\u2019s better to trickle down to a high-value rare or common item than leave gold unspent. Every round should push your stats or survivability forward.\n\n [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) -  High WP + crit utility; aggressive, but risky outside of damage-boost-centric teams.\n\n [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) - Massive burst WP, though rarely needed unless you\u2019re leaning into Valk blaster plays.\n\n [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) - Still a solid WP filler, but mostly outscaled by Amari\u2019s by this point.\n\n [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) -  If you\u2019re still running it from R3, it synergizes well\u2014but you may consider swapping up if you need raw output.\n\n [Compensator](item_2a354f80-610c-4661-9bdd-8960ae1a60b0) /  [Weapon Grease](item_961ae72f-434f-406b-a89b-ab8efec806bf) - Great green-tier picks for healing tempo; keep them in if you\u2019re gold-starved this round.\n\n [First Aid Kit](item_0172eaaa-1902-44a3-b989-d12f0f7301da) - Still valuable if you\u2019re getting poked often or need regen uptime during long duels.\n\n## Round 5 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Valk = team reset. Don\u2019t hold it\u2014pop it early to stabilize. Crepuscular gives you full-team coverage instantly.\n\n- Position for maximum Crepuscular radius\u2014don\u2019t hover too high or out of range of squishies in need.\n\n- Let damage boost chains build ult passively while you reposition and farm assists.\n\n- Use Blessed Boosters to relocate vertically between fights or dodge snipers\u2014now more than ever, you\u2019re a high-value target.\n\n- Make use of your Caduceus Blaster during Valk. With beams auto-applying, you can pressure the backline, confirm kills, or interrupt angles without neglecting support duties.\n\n## Round Goal:\n\nPlay the entire team. Stop flicking. Start flowing.\nThis is the round where you stop thinking about individual beams\u2014you\u2019re thinking in auras. Valk is no longer just a mobility tool; it\u2019s a fight-winner. With Chain Evoker\u2019s armor and Crepuscular\u2019s coverage, you are now the reason your team doesn\u2019t wipe.",

        "notes": "# **Round 6 \u2013 Damage-Capable Mercy & Pressure Finish**\n\nAt this stage, your power loadout is already solid:\n\n- Threads of Fate \u2013 consistent dual support\n\n- Triage Unit \u2013 reactive low-HP spike healing\n\n- Crepuscular Circle \u2013 AoE healing/boost during Valk\n\nWith item scaling peaking, you now begin to lean into pressure tools\u2014not just to heal, but to end fights.\n\n*This round is about owning tempo. Your team doesn\u2019t just recover anymore\u2014they win off your presence. You\u2019ve got enough sustain\u2014now you play for pick pressure, ult rotation, and cleanup.*\n\n## Items:\n\n [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) \n\n- Adds a massive flat Weapon Power boost, immediately spiking both your healing and your pistol\u2019s base damage.\n\n- Grants +10% damage against enemies under 30% HP, which directly benefits Mercy\u2019s ability to clean up squishies during Valkyrie.\n\n- This turns you into a finisher\u2014one who doesn\u2019t rely entirely on teammates to close low-health targets.\n\n [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) \n\n- Pairs well with Eye of the Spider to enable burst pressure with your pistol.\n\n- Revealed targets are easier to track and clean up during Valk\u2019s mobile gunplay.\n\n- The bonus Weapon Power also contributes to healing, giving this item some hybrid utility, even if it skews aggressive.\n\n [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) \n\n- Still essential. You\u2019re more lethal now\u2014so you\u2019re more hunted. Blessed Boosters allows for tight aerial repositioning to punish or evade.\n\n- Still your most consistent anti-dive tool.\n\n [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) \n\n- The glue that holds your healing together, even while you pressure with damage.\n\n- Still scales Valk\u2019s multi-beam healing, especially on low-health allies when you break off to engage or kite.\n\n [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) \n\n- Keeps your beams smooth and your body in motion.\n\n- As you start to split your time between healing and shooting, this ensures your beam tempo remains intact when you need it most.\n\n [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) \n\n- Grants +50 Armor, helping you absorb chip damage (small, frequent hits over time), poke pressure (ranged harassment that forces you to back up or reposition), and survive ult trades (when both teams commit their ultimates in a single teamfight).\n\n- The +5% damage boost increases your team\u2019s offensive output, and the +15% ultimate charge from boosting ensures you cycle Valkyrie faster\u2014even outside of direct healing.\n\n- This is a meta-stable pick\u2014armor to survive, boost to empower, and charge to keep Valk in play.\n\n## Optional/Swap Items:\n\nIf you're adapting to the enemy comp or struggling to survive, these are excellent pivots:\n\n [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) - +50 Armor; grants scaling damage reduction when under pressure.\n\n [Rustung Von Wilhelm](item_aea17a63-3f55-4f91-8f49-a7793fbc56c4) - Health/Armor/Shield increase + DR when low.\n\n [Advanced Nanobiotics](item_26fcf7c9-b81a-4d8e-a459-b515519cb73e) - Still decent for AS burst chaining, but largely outscaled by this stage unless you need smoother flick-healing.\n\n [Talon Modification Module](item_c0ca1795-a3ea-4dc9-ae17-f34122574b3a) -  May still be relevant for raw WP if Eye/Closer aren\u2019t in play or the pistol role isn't needed.\n\n## Round 6 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Use your pistol in Valk. You\u2019ve now built for it. Aim for low-health stragglers, flankers, or zone control\u2014especially when beams are already covering your team via Crepuscular.\n\n- Watch for Triage triggers midfight, then flick back to pistol pressure before GA repositioning.\n\n- Don\u2019t panic-GA. You now have the tools to juke, shoot, and survive\u2014mix your beams and blaster based on the fight state.\n\n- Chain Evoker is still feeding you ult. Consider activating Valk earlier in fights to force tempo and let Eye/Closer go to work.\n\n## Round Goal:\n\nBecome a fight closer. Heal what lives. Clean up what doesn\u2019t.\nYou\u2019re no longer just a support\u2014you\u2019re a force multiplier. With AoE beams online and finishing tools in hand, Mercy in Round 6 isn\u2019t hiding behind a tank. She\u2019s winning fights in the air, mid-team, mid-storm.",

Once your allies are topped off, your healing doesn\u2019t stop\u2014it starts overflowing into temporary HP, strengthening your team\u2019s durability against poke, chip, and ult spikes.\n\nThis is especially powerful with:\n\n- Crepuscular Circle, which spreads this overhealth to your whole team during Valk.\n\n- Amari\u2019s Antidote, which boosts your base healing numbers to make that overhealth tick faster.\n\n- Chain Evoker, which enables more Valk usage and makes that overflow a consistent teamwide layer of protection.\n\n## Optional Power Picks (Situational Swaps)\n\nDepending on how your match is playing out, you might consider:\n\n [Battle Medic](item_ccd0edff-4d57-4ac2-83a7-bab6ff0ffb2f) \n\n- This option leans into a pistol-heavy Valk playstyle. If you\u2019re consistently getting value from blaster cleanup or poking between heals, this ramps your fire rate for kill confirms. Great if the enemy has squishy targets or you\u2019re dueling often.\n\n [Serenity](item_c6e1c072-ff50-467e-b59f-9506baea10c1) \n\n- This is a self-sustain fallback, ideal if you\u2019re being chipped frequently or forced out of position. It helps stabilize your own health during high uptime without needing to peel off allies or break your beam to survive. Especially useful if you\u2019re healing a lot of full-health allies and not gaining much value elsewhere.\n\n- *Choose Glass Extra Full when your team\u2019s tempo is strong and you want to dominate fights through momentum.*\n- *Choose Serenity if you\u2019re being worn down.*\n- *Choose Battle Medic if you\u2019re confident in your gun and looking to close fights yourself.*\n\n## Items:\n\n [Blessed Boosters](item_957fd380-b7b4-40d4-8333-bb8c535ca931) \n\n- Still your foundation. Escape tool, reposition tool, Valk juking tool. Never sell.\n\n [Amari's Antidote](item_67e0b1c5-3bcb-4ab5-b818-5082e5706124) \n\n- Your team\u2019s lifeline and still the most efficient heal-scaling item in the kit.\n\n [Booster Jets](item_a291de85-b6d9-43cf-b5da-f3184a156f48) \n\n- Keeps AS high and positioning sharp, letting you rotate between flicks or stabilize team fights efficiently.\n\n [Chain Evoker](item_812cc89e-feb0-47d0-9e03-9d8e33a80aca) \n\n- Grants +50 Armor, helping you absorb chip damage (small, frequent hits over time), poke pressure (ranged harassment that forces you to back up or reposition), and survive ult trades (when both teams commit their ultimates in a single teamfight).\n\n- The +5% damage boost increases your team\u2019s offensive output, and the +15% ultimate charge from boosting ensures you cycle Valkyrie faster\u2014even outside of direct healing.\n\n- This is a meta-stable pick\u2014armor to survive, boost to empower, and charge to keep Valk in play.\n\n [Eye of the Spider](item_bbaf01d7-340d-4199-b738-86a98d68fe9b) \n\n- For clean-up and Valk gunplay. Still valuable even if you\u2019re not running Battle Medic.\n\n [The Closer](item_173c6d0f-dbe6-440e-924f-0ce08189ddce) \n\n- Enables burst damage on exposed or retreating targets. Pairs well with Valk\u2019s mobility and vertical angles.\n\n## Optional/Swap Items:\n\n [Ogundimu Reduction Field](item_b12daf48-069b-44c1-88fe-221cbcff664d) - +50 Armor; grants scaling damage reduction while under fire\u2014great against pressure comps.\n\n [Rustung Von Wilhelm](item_aea17a63-3f55-4f91-8f49-a7793fbc56c4) - Health/Armor/Shield increase + damage reduction while low\u2014adds a safety net to scrappy fights.\n\n [Nebula Conduit](item_476b7040-54c9-4f0c-8283-b4407f6809f8) - Delays a portion of incoming damage and spreads it over time\u2014excellent against burst damage and ult combos.\n\n## Round 7 Playstyle Tips:\n\n- Keep beam uptime high\u2014even on full-health allies, you\u2019re adding Overhealth that can absorb critical hits and ult splash.\n\n- In Valk, position near allies to maximize Crepuscular beam spread + Overhealth stacking.\n\n- If running Battle Medic, don\u2019t reload unless forced\u2014maintain that fire rate and clean up stragglers.\n\n- You are no longer passive. You are tempo. Teams win because of you.\n\n- Rotate cooldowns and manage beam flicks with flow\u2014don\u2019t panic GA unless needed.\n\n## Final Round Goal:\n\nOverflow. Sustain. Collapse.\nThis is Mercy\u2019s strongest form\u2014every second you\u2019re alive, your team gets stronger. Your presence is pressure, your Valk is the win condition, and your beams are a tide that can\u2019t be pushed back.",
